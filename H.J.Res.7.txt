Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have to consider the impact of this decision on my constituents and the country as a whole. While I understand the desire to move forward from the pandemic, I strongly believe that terminating the national emergency declaration prematurely would be a mistake.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on our country, and we are still feeling its effects. The national emergency declaration has allowed the federal government to respond quickly and effectively to the crisis, providing critical support to states, healthcare providers, and individuals affected by the pandemic.

Terminating the national emergency declaration now would not only undermine our ongoing response efforts but also put vulnerable populations at risk. It would also limit the ability of the federal government to respond to future outbreaks and public health emergencies.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this resolution is more of a political statement than a thoughtful policy decision. We should be focusing on supporting our healthcare system, addressing the ongoing needs of those affected by the pandemic, and preparing for future public health emergencies, rather than trying to score political points.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of their actions and to prioritize the health and well-being of the American people.

As for the cosponsors of this bill, I respect their right to introduce legislation, but I strongly disagree with their approach. I hope that in the future, we can work together to find more constructive and bipartisan solutions to address the challenges facing our country.

Now, I'd like to ask my colleagues, have we considered the potential impact of terminating the national emergency declaration on our rural communities, where access to healthcare is already limited? Have we thought about the consequences for our small businesses, which are still recovering from the economic disruption caused by the pandemic? I hope that we can have a more nuanced and thoughtful discussion about this issue, rather than rushing to judgment.

While I understand that we have made significant progress in combating the virus, I firmly believe that terminating the national emergency declaration prematurely would be a mistake. The ongoing pandemic has highlighted the importance of our public health infrastructure, and we must continue to support our healthcare providers, our states, and our communities as they respond to this crisis.

I share the concerns of my colleague, Senator Baldwin, that this resolution is more of a political statement than a thoughtful policy decision.

I appreciate the concerns raised by my colleagues, Senators Baldwin, Bennet, Blumenthal, and Booker, regarding the potential consequences of terminating the national emergency declaration. They have highlighted the importance of continuing to support our healthcare providers, states, and communities as they respond to this crisis.

However, as a conservative Republican, I also believe in the importance of fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention. I am concerned that the ongoing national emergency declaration could be used to justify excessive government spending and overreach.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of the joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: have you considered the potential impact on our healthcare system, which is still recovering from the pandemic? Have you thought about the consequences for our most vulnerable populations, including the elderly, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions? I hope that we can have a more nuanced and thoughtful discussion about this issue, rather than rushing to judgment.

In my view, this resolution is not just about terminating a national emergency declaration, but about the kind of country we want to be. Do we want to be a country that prioritizes the health and well-being of its citizens, or do we want to be a country that prioritizes partisan politics and ideological purity? I believe that we should prioritize the health and well-being of the American people, and I will be voting no on this resolution.

Therefore, I will be voting against the joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19. I believe that this resolution is a misguided attempt to score political points, and I will not support it. Instead, I will continue to work with my colleagues to find bipartisan solutions to address the challenges facing our country and to prioritize the health and well-being of the American people.

Bill Cassidy: As I consider the joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19, I must say that I agree with my colleague, Senator Capito.

As a senator from Louisiana, I have seen the impact of the pandemic on our communities and our economy. However, I also believe in the importance of fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention. I am concerned that the ongoing national emergency declaration could be used to justify excessive government spending and overreach.

I think it's time for us to start focusing on long-term solutions to support our healthcare system and communities, rather than relying on emergency measures. I believe that terminating the national emergency declaration will allow us to take a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to addressing the challenges facing our country.

To my colleagues who oppose this resolution, I ask: have you considered the potential impact of continued government intervention on our economy and our healthcare system?

I hope that we can have a more nuanced and thoughtful discussion about this issue, rather than simply relying on partisan rhetoric.

In my view, this resolution is not just about terminating a national emergency declaration, but about taking a step towards restoring the balance of power between the federal government and the states. It's about recognizing that the pandemic is no longer the crisis it once was, and that it's time for us to start transitioning back to a more normal way of life.

I urge my colleagues to consider the potential benefits of terminating the national emergency declaration, including the potential to reduce government spending, promote economic growth, and increase individual freedom.

As a senator from Maine, I have seen the impact of the pandemic on our communities, our healthcare system, and our economy. I firmly believe that the ongoing national emergency declaration is still necessary to support our healthcare providers, our states, and our communities as they respond to this crisis.

I share the concerns of my colleagues, such as Senators Cardin, Carper, and Casey, that this resolution is more of a political statement than a thoughtful policy decision. We should be focusing on supporting our healthcare system, addressing the ongoing needs of those affected by the pandemic, and preparing for future public health emergencies, rather than trying to score political points.

I am deeply concerned about the potential consequences of terminating the national emergency declaration. It would limit the ability of the federal government to respond to future outbreaks and public health emergencies, putting vulnerable populations at risk. Our rural communities, where access to healthcare is already limited, would be disproportionately affected. Small businesses, which are still recovering from the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, would also face significant challenges.

Richard J. Durbin: I rise in opposition to this joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19. While I understand the desire to move away from emergency measures and towards a more normal way of life, I strongly believe that terminating the national emergency declaration at this time would be premature and potentially harmful to our nation's public health and economy.

As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on our country, with millions of Americans infected and thousands of lives lost. While we have made significant progress in combating the virus, it is still a serious threat, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and those with underlying health conditions.

Terminating the national emergency declaration would undermine our ability to respond to this ongoing public health crisis. It would limit our ability to provide critical support to our healthcare system, including funding for testing, contact tracing, and vaccine distribution. It would also hinder our efforts to support small businesses and workers who are still struggling to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic.

I am also concerned about the potential consequences of terminating the national emergency declaration on our nation's healthcare system. It could lead to a surge in hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in rural and underserved areas where healthcare resources are already scarce. It could also exacerbate existing health disparities and worsen health outcomes for marginalized communities.

Furthermore, I disagree with my colleagues who argue that the national emergency declaration is being used to justify excessive government spending and overreach. The reality is that the declaration has been used to provide critical support to our healthcare system and economy, and to save lives.

In response to my colleagues' comments, I would like to say that I appreciate Senator Collins' concerns about the potential impact on rural communities and small businesses. However, I believe that we can find alternative solutions to support these communities without relying on terminating the national emergency declaration.

To Senator Cotton, I would say that I understand his desire to transition away from emergency measures, but I strongly disagree with his assessment that the pandemic is no longer a crisis. The reality is that the pandemic is still a serious threat, and we need to continue to take bold action to combat it.

To Senator Cruz, I would say that I appreciate his commitment to fiscal responsibility, but I believe that terminating the national emergency declaration would be a false economy. It would save us money in the short term, but it would cost us dearly in the long term in terms of lives lost and economic damage.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and to continue to support our nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We owe it to the American people to take this crisis seriously and to do everything in our power to protect their health and well-being. I will be voting against this resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing it.

The pandemic has indeed made tremendous progress, and it's time for us to start transitioning away from the emergency measures that were put in place during the height of the crisis.

As a senator from Nebraska, I've seen the impact of the pandemic on our rural communities and our economy. However, I also believe in the importance of fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention. I'm concerned that the ongoing national emergency declaration could be used to justify excessive government spending and overreach.

I think it's time for us to start focusing on long-term solutions to support our healthcare system and communities, rather than relying on emergency measures. Terminating the national emergency declaration will allow us to take a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to addressing the challenges facing our country.

I understand that some of my colleagues, like Senators Durbin and Duckworth, have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of terminating the national emergency declaration. However, I believe that these concerns are overstated, and we can find alternative solutions to support our healthcare system and communities without relying on emergency measures.

To my colleagues who oppose this resolution, I ask: have you considered the potential impact of continued government intervention on our economy and our healthcare system? Have you thought about the consequences of perpetuating a state of emergency indefinitely? I hope that we can have a more nuanced and thoughtful discussion about this issue, rather than simply relying on partisan rhetoric.

In my view, this resolution is not just about terminating a national emergency declaration, but about taking a step towards restoring the balance of power between the federal government and the states. It's about recognizing that the pandemic is no longer the crisis it once was, and that it's time for us to start transitioning back to a more normal way of life.

I urge my colleagues to consider the potential benefits of terminating the national emergency declaration, including the potential to reduce government spending, promote economic growth, and increase individual freedom. I believe that this resolution is a step in the right direction, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to find more constructive and bipartisan solutions to address the challenges facing our country.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of the joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19.

Kirsten E. Gillibrand: I rise in opposition to this joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19. As Senator Durbin so eloquently stated, terminating the national emergency declaration at this time would be premature and potentially harmful to our nation's public health and economy.

While I understand the desire to move away from emergency measures and towards a more normal way of life, I strongly believe that we must prioritize the health and well-being of the American people. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on our country, and it is still a serious threat, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and those with underlying health conditions.

Terminating the national emergency declaration would undermine our ability to respond to this ongoing public health crisis. It would limit our ability to provide critical support to our healthcare system, including funding for testing, contact tracing, and vaccine distribution. It would also hinder our efforts to support small businesses and workers who are still struggling to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic.

I am concerned that my colleagues who support this resolution are not taking into account the potential consequences of terminating the national emergency declaration. It could lead to a surge in hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in rural and underserved areas where healthcare resources are already scarce. It could also exacerbate existing health disparities and worsen health outcomes for marginalized communities.

I would like to address the comments made by Senators Ernst, Fischer, and others who support this resolution. While I understand their concerns about fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention, I believe that these concerns are overstated. The national emergency declaration has been used to provide critical support to our healthcare system and economy, and to save lives.

In response to Senator Ernst's comments, I would say that I appreciate her willingness to work with me to find bipartisan solutions to support our healthcare system and communities. However, I strongly disagree with her assessment that the pandemic is no longer a crisis. The reality is that the pandemic is still a serious threat, and we need to continue to take bold action to combat it.

To Senator Fischer, I would say that I understand her concerns about the potential impact of continued government intervention on our economy and our healthcare system. However, I believe that we can find alternative solutions to support our healthcare system and communities without relying on emergency measures. I'd be happy to work with her to find bipartisan solutions that prioritize the health and well-being of our communities.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and to continue to support our nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We owe it to the American people to take this crisis seriously and to do everything in our power to protect their health and well-being. I will be voting against this resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing it.

As I cast my vote, I am reminded of the importance of putting the needs of the American people above partisan politics. This is not a time for ideological grandstanding or political posturing. This is a time for leadership, for compassion, and for a commitment to the well-being of our nation.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in prioritizing the health and well-being of the American people.

The national emergency declaration has provided critical resources and flexibility to our healthcare system, communities, and economy, and terminating it would undermine our ability to respond to this ongoing public health crisis.

I'd like to respond to Senator Tuberville's comments about trusting the American people to make their own decisions and take care of themselves. While I understand his concerns about government overreach, I believe that we can address those concerns through other means, such as increased oversight and transparency, rather than terminating the national emergency declaration.

As a senator who has consistently pushed for a balanced approach to addressing the pandemic, I believe that maintaining the national emergency declaration is necessary to ensure that we can continue to respond to this ongoing public health crisis. I've worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to provide support to affected communities, and I believe that we must continue to prioritize the health and well-being of the American people.

In conclusion, I will be voting against the joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19. I believe that it's essential to prioritize the health and well-being of the American people, and that includes maintaining the national emergency declaration until we are confident that the pandemic is under control. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and to work with me to find bipartisan solutions that support our nation's response to this pandemic.

I will be voting "Nay" on this resolution.

Roger F. Wicker: As I consider the joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19, I must say that I'm inclined to support it. As a senator from Mississippi, I've seen the impact of the pandemic on our communities, and while I understand the concerns about the potential consequences of terminating the national emergency declaration, I believe that it's time for us to start taking a more nuanced approach to addressing the pandemic.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Dan Sullivan, John Thune, and Tommy Tuberville, that we've made significant progress in combating the pandemic, and I believe that we can continue to address the ongoing public health crisis without the need for emergency measures. I understand that some of my colleagues have concerns about the potential consequences of terminating the national emergency declaration, and I respect their opinions.

However, I believe that we can address those concerns through other means, such as increased oversight and transparency, rather than maintaining the national emergency declaration indefinitely. As a senator who has consistently pushed for a balanced approach to addressing the pandemic, I believe that terminating the national emergency declaration is a necessary step towards restoring balance and accountability to our government.

I'd like to respond to Senators Jon Tester and Chris Van Hollen, who have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of terminating the national emergency declaration. While I understand their concerns, I believe that we can achieve our goals without maintaining the national emergency declaration. I also appreciate Senator Mike Lee's comments about the need for a more nuanced approach to addressing the pandemic, and I agree that we must be willing to adapt and evolve our response as needed.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of the joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19. I believe that it's time for us to start taking a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to addressing the pandemic, and that includes being willing to adapt and evolve our response as needed. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and to work with me to find bipartisan solutions that support our nation's response to this pandemic.

I will be voting "Yea" on this resolution.

Ron Wyden: As I consider the joint resolution to terminate the national emergency concerning COVID-19, I must say that I strongly oppose this resolution. As a senator from Oregon, I've seen the impact of the pandemic on our communities, and I believe that terminating the national emergency declaration at this time would be premature and potentially reckless.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Mark Warner, Raphael Warnock, Elizabeth Warren, and Peter Welch, that the pandemic is still a significant threat to our nation's health and economy, and we must continue to take bold action to combat it. We've made progress, but we're not out of the woods yet. We still have communities that are struggling, healthcare workers who are exhausted, and families who are grieving.

The national emergency declaration has provided critical resources and flexibility to our healthcare system, communities, and economy. It has allowed us to respond quickly and effectively to the evolving pandemic, and it has saved lives. I'm concerned that terminating the declaration would undermine our ability to respond to this ongoing public health crisis and put the most vulnerable members of our society at risk.

I understand that some of my colleagues, like Senators Roger Wicker, Dan Sullivan, John Thune, and Tommy Tuberville, believe that we can address the ongoing public health crisis without the need for emergency measures.
