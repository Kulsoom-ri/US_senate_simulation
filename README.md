# LLMs for Political Decision-Making

## Research Question
How accurately can Large Language Models (LLMs) simulate human behaviour, particularly in decision-making? A study in the context of the US Senate.

## Introduction
Political scientists have increasingly employed quantitative predictive methods to model legislative processes in the US Congress, particularly to predict vote outcomes. These methods range from simple binary classifiers to more sophisticated models, such as logistic regression, text models and machine learning. One such logisitic regression model achieved 88% prediction accuracy without considering individual vote histories allowing it to be generalized to future new Congress members (Henighan & Kravitz, 2015). Another study used word vectors to capture specific words that increase the probability of a bill becoming law and compared text models with context-only models (Nay, 2017).

With the advent of generative AI, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in forecasting is gaining increasing attention. A recent study demonstrated that an ensemble of LLMs could "achieve forecasting accuracy rivaling that of human crowd forecasting tournaments," effectively replicating the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect (Schoenegger et al., 2024).

This research introduces a novel probabilistic approach to simulating political decision-making using an LLM-powered multi-agent framework. The study constructs a network of 100 LLM agents that simulate the 118th US Senate, where the agents vote on real bills after three rounds of discussion. This work offers contributions across several fields. In Political Science, it tests the potential of synthetic data for simulating survey studies, examining the quality and realism of LLM-generated data. In Computer Science, it contributes to understanding the predictive capabilities of LLMs and expanding their use in traditional machine learning tasks. In the field of Human-AI Co-evolution, it tests the idea of AI agents replicating human behaviour, helping us understand the potential for AI to interact with and complement human decision-making in real-world scenarios.
