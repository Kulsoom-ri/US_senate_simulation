Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 98, seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the National Labor Relations Board regarding the standard for determining joint employer status. As a senator who has always prioritized the rights and protections of workers, I must express my strong opposition to this resolution.

The NLRB's rule, which took effect on February 26, 2024, provides a clear and necessary standard for determining when two employers are jointly responsible for the terms and conditions of employment. This rule is essential for protecting workers who are often caught in the middle of complex employment arrangements, where multiple employers may be exerting control over their working conditions.

By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a significant step backward in our efforts to protect workers' rights. We would be allowing employers to avoid accountability for their actions and to shift the burden of responsibility onto other employers or onto the workers themselves.

I understand that some of my colleagues may argue that this rule is overly broad or burdensome, but I believe that these concerns are misplaced. The NLRB's rule is a carefully crafted and nuanced standard that takes into account the complexities of modern employment arrangements.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I have seen firsthand the importance of protecting workers' rights. Our state has a long history of strong labor unions and a commitment to fair labor practices. I believe that this resolution would undermine those values and would harm the very workers who are most in need of protection.

Therefore, I will be voting against H.J. Res. 98. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and in standing up for the rights and protections of workers across our country.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what is the justification for nullifying a rule that has been carefully crafted to protect workers' rights? What evidence do you have that this rule is causing harm to employers or to the economy? I believe that we must prioritize the well-being and dignity of workers, and I will not support any effort to undermine their rights and protections.

John Barrasso: The joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 98, is a crucial step in protecting the interests of American businesses and promoting economic growth. As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of overregulation on our economy and our small businesses.

The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a perfect example of government overreach. This rule would impose significant burdens on employers, particularly small businesses and franchises, by making them liable for the actions of other employers over which they have no control. This would lead to increased costs, reduced hiring, and decreased economic growth.

I strongly disagree with my colleague, Senator Baldwin, who claims that this rule is necessary to protect workers' rights. In reality, this rule would have a chilling effect on job creation and economic development. It would also lead to increased litigation and regulatory uncertainty, which would harm both employers and employees.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I have seen the impact of overregulation on our energy industry. The NLRB's rule on joint employer status would have a similar impact on businesses across our country. It would stifle innovation, reduce competition, and harm the very workers it claims to protect.

I also take issue with Senator Baldwin's claim that this rule is carefully crafted and nuanced. In reality, this rule is a one-size-fits-all solution that fails to take into account the complexities of modern employment arrangements. It would impose significant burdens on employers, particularly those in the franchise industry, and would lead to increased costs and reduced hiring.

I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 98, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. We must stand up for American businesses and promote economic growth, rather than imposing burdensome regulations that harm our economy and our workers.

To Senator Baldwin, I say that the justification for nullifying this rule is clear: it is a burdensome and overreaching regulation that would harm American businesses and stifle economic growth. The evidence is clear: this rule would lead to increased costs, reduced hiring, and decreased economic growth. We must prioritize the interests of American businesses and workers, and reject this flawed rule.

Michael F. Bennet: The debate on H.J. Res. 98 has been quite lively, and I appreciate the passion from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against H.J. Res. 98. While I understand the concerns about the potential impact of the NLRB's rule on small businesses and franchises, I believe that the rule is a necessary step in protecting workers' rights and promoting fair labor practices.

As Senator Baldwin so eloquently pointed out, the NLRB's rule provides a clear and necessary standard for determining joint employer status, which is essential for protecting workers who are often caught in the middle of complex employment arrangements. By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a significant step backward in our efforts to protect workers' rights and promote fair labor practices.

I also take issue with the argument that this rule is overly broad or burdensome. The NLRB's rule is a carefully crafted and nuanced standard that takes into account the complexities of modern employment arrangements. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, as some of my colleagues have suggested, but rather a thoughtful and balanced approach to promoting fair labor practices.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what's the alternative? How do you propose we protect workers' rights and promote fair labor practices if we nullify this rule? I believe that we must prioritize the well-being and dignity of workers, and I will not support any effort to undermine their rights and protections.

In conclusion, I will be voting against H.J. Res. 98, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution. Let's work together to find pragmatic solutions that promote fair labor practices, protect workers' rights, and support American businesses. We can do better than this.

Thomas R. Carper: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to protecting the rights of workers and promoting fair labor practices. The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a crucial step in ensuring that workers are treated with dignity and respect, and that employers are held accountable for their actions.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues, Senators Barrasso, Blackburn, Boozman, Braun, Britt, and Budd, who claim that this rule is an example of government overreach and would impose significant burdens on employers. As a senator from Delaware, I've seen firsthand the impact of exploitation and abuse on workers, particularly in industries where joint employment arrangements are common.

The NLRB's rule provides a clear and necessary standard for determining joint employer status, and it's essential for protecting workers who are often caught in the middle of complex employment arrangements. By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a significant step backward in our efforts to promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Baldwin, Bennet, Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Butler, and Cantwell, who have pointed out that the NLRB's rule is a carefully crafted and nuanced standard that takes into account the complexities of modern employment arrangements. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a thoughtful and balanced approach to promoting fair labor practices.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what's the justification for nullifying a rule that has been carefully crafted to protect workers' rights? What evidence do you have that this rule is causing harm to employers or to the economy? I believe that we must prioritize the well-being and dignity of workers, and I will not support any effort to undermine their rights and protections.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Barrasso, Blackburn, Boozman, Braun, and Britt, who have pointed out that this rule would have a chilling effect on job creation and economic development. As a senator from Louisiana, I've seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our economy and our small businesses. This rule would make employers liable for the actions of other employers over which they have no control, leading to increased costs, reduced hiring, and decreased economic growth.

I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Senators Baldwin, Bennet, Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Butler, Cantwell, Cardin, Carper, and Casey, who claim that this rule is necessary to protect workers' rights. In reality, this rule would have a disproportionate impact on small businesses and franchises, which are the backbone of our economy. As a champion for small businesses and a proponent of rolling back burdensome regulations, I understand the importance of creating a favorable business environment that allows companies to thrive and create jobs.

I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 98, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. We must stand up for American businesses and promote economic growth, rather than imposing burdensome regulations that harm our economy and our workers.

In response to Senator Cantwell's comments, I would like to say that I appreciate her passion and conviction, but I must respectfully disagree with her assessment of the NLRB's rule.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues, such as Senator Capito, who argue that the rule would impose significant burdens on employers, particularly small businesses and franchises, I also appreciate the concerns of my colleagues, such as Senator Cardin, who argue that the rule is necessary to protect workers' rights.

As a senator from Maine, I have seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our economy and our small businesses. However, I also believe that we must prioritize the well-being and dignity of workers. I am concerned that nullifying the NLRB's rule could have unintended consequences, such as undermining the protections that workers currently have under the law.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against H.J. Res. 98. I believe that we should work together to find pragmatic solutions that promote fair labor practices, protect workers' rights, and support American businesses.

Joni Ernst: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation in our great nation, particularly in the state of Iowa. The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a prime example of government overreach, and I firmly believe that it would impose significant burdens on employers, particularly small businesses and franchises.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Barrasso, Blackburn, Boozman, Braun, and Britt, who have pointed out that this rule would have a chilling effect on job creation and economic development. As a senator from Iowa, I've seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our economy and our small businesses. This rule would make employers liable for the actions of other employers over which they have no control, leading to increased costs, reduced hiring, and decreased economic growth.

I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Senators Baldwin, Bennet, Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Butler, Cantwell, Cardin, and Casey, who claim that this rule is necessary to protect workers' rights. In reality, this rule would have a disproportionate impact on small businesses and franchises, which are the backbone of our economy.

I'd like to respond to Senator Coons' comments, who asked what's the justification for nullifying a rule that has been carefully crafted to protect workers' rights. I believe that the NLRB's rule is an example of government overreach, and it's not a carefully crafted solution, but rather a one-size-fits-all approach that would harm American businesses and workers.

To Senator Cortez Masto, who suggested that we should work together to find alternative solutions that promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, I say that I'm open to finding common ground. However, I believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step in promoting economic growth and job creation.

We should be working to support workers, not undermine their rights.

I'd like to respond to Senators Cruz and Daines, who claim that this rule is an example of government overreach. I disagree. This rule is a necessary measure to protect workers and to promote fair labor practices. We should be standing up for workers, not catering to the interests of big businesses and corporations.

Ron Johnson: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation in Wisconsin. The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a prime example of government overreach, and I firmly believe that it would impose significant burdens on employers, particularly small businesses and franchises.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and others, who have pointed out that this rule would have a chilling effect on job creation and economic development. As a senator from Wisconsin, I've seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our economy and our small businesses. This rule would make employers liable for the actions of other employers over which they have no control, leading to increased costs, reduced hiring, and decreased economic growth.

I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Senators Heinrich, Hickenlooper, and Hirono, who claim that this rule is necessary to protect workers' rights. In reality, this rule would have a disproportionate impact on small businesses and franchises, which are the backbone of our economy.

I'd like to respond to Senator Heinrich's comments, who suggested that this rule is a crucial step forward in protecting the rights of workers and ensuring that employers are held accountable for their actions. I understand his concerns, but I believe that this rule is an example of government overreach, and it's not a carefully crafted solution, but rather a one-size-fits-all approach that would harm American businesses and workers.

To Senator Hickenlooper, who suggested that we should be standing up for workers, not catering to the interests of big businesses and corporations, I say that I'm committed to promoting economic growth and job creation, and I believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step in achieving that goal.

As a senator who has long been committed to promoting economic growth and job creation, I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 98, which nullifies the National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and standing up for American businesses, promoting economic growth, and creating jobs for the American people.

In particular, I'd like to address Senator Hirono's concerns about protecting workers' rights. I believe that we can find ways to protect workers' rights without imposing burdensome regulations on American businesses. Perhaps we can work together to find alternative solutions that promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses.

I also want to acknowledge the comments made by Senators Cruz and Daines, who have expressed similar concerns about the impact of this rule on small businesses and franchises. I agree with their assessment that this rule is an example of government overreach and that nullifying it is a necessary step in promoting economic growth and job creation.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 98, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

John Kennedy: The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status - now that's a doozy, folks. I've been listening to my colleagues debate this issue, and I've got to say, I'm firmly in the camp of those who think this rule is a prime example of government overreach.

I mean, think about it. This rule would make employers liable for the actions of other employers over which they have no control. That's just plain crazy. It's like saying that if I'm a franchisor, I'm responsible for the actions of every single franchisee, even if I don't have any control over their day-to-day operations. It's a recipe for disaster, and it's going to have a chilling effect on job creation and economic development.

Now, I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to say that this rule is necessary to protect workers' rights. And I'm all for protecting workers' rights, don't get me wrong. But this rule is not the way to do it. It's a one-size-fits-all approach that's going to harm American businesses and workers.

I've got to say, I'm disappointed but not surprised by the comments from Senators Kaine and Kelly. They're just drinking the Kool-Aid, folks. They think that this rule is going to help workers, but it's just going to end up hurting them in the long run.

As for me, I'm going to be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 98. I think it's a necessary step to promote economic growth and job creation, and to stop the government from overreaching its authority. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and standing up for American businesses.

And let me tell you, I'm not just talking about big businesses and corporations. I'm talking about small businesses and franchises, too. These are the backbone of our economy, folks, and we need to be supporting them, not burdening them with unnecessary regulations.

So, I'll be voting yes on H.J. Res. 98. It's the right thing to do for American businesses, for workers, and for our economy.

The one-size-fits-all approach would stifle economic growth and job creation, particularly in states like South Dakota, where small businesses and entrepreneurship are crucial to our economy.

I understand the concerns expressed by Senators Kyrsten Sinema, Tina Smith, and Debbie Stabenow about protecting workers' rights, and I agree that we must find ways to promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights.

Roger F. Wicker: The joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to nullify the National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status. As a senator from Mississippi, I have carefully considered the potential impact of this rule on our state's economy and workers.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and instead work together to find solutions that support American businesses and promote economic growth, while also protecting workers' rights.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential impact on American businesses, I suggest that we work together to find alternative solutions that promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses. Perhaps we can explore ways to provide incentives for businesses to adopt fair labor practices, or to provide training and resources for workers to help them navigate the changing job market.

I'd like to respond to Senator Wicker's comments, who suggested that this rule is an example of government overreach and would harm American businesses and workers. I understand his concerns, but I believe that this rule is a necessary step to protect workers and promote fair labor practices. Instead of nullifying this rule, we should work together to find alternative solutions that support American businesses and promote economic growth, while also protecting workers' rights.

John Barrasso: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation in my state of Wyoming. The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.

After weighing the potential impact on workers, employers, and our economy, I have decided to vote yes on H.J. Res. 98. I agree with my colleagues, such as Senator Roger Wicker, who argue that this rule is an example of government overreach and would harm American businesses and workers. The rule in question establishes a new joint employer standard that would unfairly burden small businesses and franchises, leading to increased costs and reduced job creation.

As a senator from Wyoming, I am committed to protecting the interests of our state's small businesses and entrepreneurs, who are the backbone of our economy. I believe that this rule would have a disproportionate impact on rural areas, where small businesses and franchises are often the lifeblood of the local economy. By nullifying this rule, we can help to promote economic growth and job creation in these areas, while also protecting the rights of workers.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Whitehouse, Wyden, and Baldwin, argue that this rule is necessary to protect workers and promote fair labor practices. However, I believe that we can achieve this goal through other means that do not involve burdensome regulations. For example, we could work to strengthen existing labor laws and enforcement mechanisms, rather than creating new and unnecessary rules.

In response to my colleagues who argue that this rule is necessary to protect workers, I would say that we must balance the need to protect workers with the need to promote economic growth and job creation. We cannot simply impose burdensome regulations on businesses without considering the potential consequences. Instead, we should work together to find alternative solutions that promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses.

Michael F. Bennet: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to protecting workers' rights and promoting fair labor practices. The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.

After weighing the potential impact on workers, employers, and our economy, I have decided to vote against H.J. Res. 98.

Instead, I believe that this rule is a necessary step to protect workers and promote fair labor practices.

The rule establishes a new joint employer standard for determining whether two employers simultaneously employ a particular employee or employees. This standard is essential to ensure that workers are protected from exploitation and that employers are held accountable for their actions. By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a step backward and allowing employers to avoid their responsibilities to their employees.

Sherrod Brown: I strongly disagree with my Republican colleagues who are supporting this joint resolution to nullify the National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status. This rule is a crucial step forward in protecting the rights of workers and promoting fair labor practices. By establishing a new joint employer standard, we can ensure that workers are not exploited by employers who try to avoid their responsibilities by using subcontractors or franchises.

As a senator from Ohio, I have seen firsthand the impact of unfair labor practices on workers and their families. I have met with workers who have been denied fair wages, benefits, and safe working conditions because their employers have tried to avoid their responsibilities by using loopholes in the law. This rule would help to close those loopholes and ensure that workers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

I also disagree with the argument that this rule would harm American businesses and workers. In fact, I believe that it would have the opposite effect. By promoting fair labor practices and protecting workers' rights, we can help to create a more stable and productive workforce, which would benefit businesses and the economy as a whole.

By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a step backward and allowing employers to avoid their responsibilities to their employees. We must balance the need to protect workers with the need to promote economic growth and job creation, but we cannot do so at the expense of workers' rights.

I would like to ask Senator Booker if he would like to add anything to his comments, and if he has any suggestions for alternative solutions that could promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses. I believe that we can work together to find a solution that benefits everyone, and I am willing to listen to any ideas that my colleagues may have.

Ted Budd: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation in my state of North Carolina.

Laphonza R. Butler: I strongly disagree with my Republican colleagues who are supporting this joint resolution to nullify the National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status. As a senator from California and a long-time advocate for workers' rights, I believe that this rule is a crucial step forward in protecting the rights of workers and promoting fair labor practices.

The rule in question establishes a new joint employer standard that would help to ensure that workers are not exploited by employers who try to avoid their responsibilities by using subcontractors or franchises. This is a common practice in industries such as construction, agriculture, and hospitality, where workers are often hired through temporary agencies or subcontractors.

By establishing a clear joint employer standard, we can help to prevent employers from avoiding their responsibilities to provide fair wages, benefits, and safe working conditions. This is not only a matter of fairness and justice, but it is also essential for promoting economic growth and stability.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential impact of this rule on small businesses and franchises. However, I believe that these concerns are overstated and that the benefits of this rule far outweigh any potential costs.

In fact, many small businesses and franchises already recognize the importance of treating their workers fairly and providing them with good wages and benefits. By establishing a clear joint employer standard, we can help to level the playing field and ensure that all employers are held to the same standards.

I would like to respond to Senator Braun's comments, who suggested that this rule is an example of government overreach and would harm American businesses and workers. I disagree with this assessment and believe that this rule is a necessary step to protect workers and promote fair labor practices.

I would also like to respond to Senator Britt's comments, who suggested that this rule would have a disproportionate impact on rural areas. While it is true that small businesses and franchises may be more prevalent in rural areas, I believe that this rule would actually help to promote economic growth and job creation in these areas by ensuring that workers are treated fairly and provided with good wages and benefits.

In conclusion, I will be voting no on H.J. Res. 98, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution.

We must balance the need to protect workers with the need to promote economic growth and job creation, but we cannot do so at the expense of workers' rights.

I would like to ask Senator Brown if he would like to add anything to his comments, and if he has any suggestions for alternative solutions that could promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses. I believe that we can work together to find a solution that benefits everyone, and I am willing to listen to any ideas that my colleagues may have.

Shelley Moore Capito: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation in my state of West Virginia. The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.

After weighing the potential impact on workers, employers, and our economy, I have decided to vote yes on H.J. Res. 98. I agree with my colleagues, such as Senators Wicker, Young, and Barrasso, who argue that this rule is an example of government overreach and would harm American businesses and workers. The rule in question establishes a new joint employer standard that would unfairly burden small businesses and franchises, leading to increased costs and reduced job creation.

As a senator from West Virginia, I am committed to protecting the interests of our state's small businesses and entrepreneurs, who are the backbone of our economy. I believe that this rule would have a disproportionate impact on rural areas, where small businesses and franchises are often the lifeblood of the local economy. By nullifying this rule, we can help to promote economic growth and job creation in these areas, while also protecting the rights of workers.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Brown, Butler, and Cantwell, argue that this rule is necessary to protect workers and promote fair labor practices. However, I believe that we can achieve this goal through other means that do not involve burdensome regulations. For example, we could work to strengthen existing labor laws and enforcement mechanisms, rather than creating new and unnecessary rules.

In response to my colleagues who argue that this rule is necessary to protect workers, I would say that we must balance the need to protect workers with the need to promote economic growth and job creation. We cannot simply impose burdensome regulations on businesses without considering the potential consequences. Instead, we should work together to find alternative solutions that promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses.

In conclusion, I will be voting yes on H.J. Res. 98, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. Let us stand up for American businesses and workers, and reject this unnecessary and burdensome regulation. As a senator from West Virginia, I believe that we can do better than this rule, and I will be voting yes on H.J. Res. 98.

Benjamin L. Cardin: I strongly disagree with my Republican colleagues who are supporting this joint resolution to nullify the National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status. As a senator from Maryland and a long-time advocate for workers' rights, I believe that this rule is a crucial step forward in protecting the rights of workers and promoting fair labor practices.

The rule in question establishes a new joint employer standard that would help to ensure that workers are not exploited by employers who try to avoid their responsibilities by using subcontractors or franchises. This is a common practice in industries such as construction, agriculture, and hospitality, where workers are often hired through temporary agencies or subcontractors.

By establishing a clear joint employer standard, we can help to prevent employers from avoiding their responsibilities to provide fair wages, benefits, and safe working conditions. This is not only a matter of fairness and justice, but it is also essential for promoting economic growth and stability.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential impact of this rule on small businesses and franchises. However, I believe that these concerns are overstated and that the benefits of this rule far outweigh any potential costs.

In fact, many small businesses and franchises already recognize the importance of treating their workers fairly and providing them with good wages and benefits. By establishing a clear joint employer standard, we can help to level the playing field and ensure that all employers are held to the same standards.

I would like to respond to Senator Budd's comments, who suggested that this rule is an example of government overreach and would harm American businesses and workers. I disagree with this assessment and believe that this rule is a necessary step to protect workers and promote fair labor practices.

I also disagree with Senator Capito's comments, who suggested that this rule would have a disproportionate impact on rural areas. While it is true that small businesses and franchises may be more prevalent in rural areas, I believe that this rule would actually help to promote economic growth and job creation in these areas by ensuring that workers are treated fairly and provided with good wages and benefits.

In conclusion, I will be voting no on H.J. Res. 98, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution. Let us stand up for American workers and promote fair labor practices, rather than imposing burdensome regulations that harm our economy and our workers. We can do better than this rule, and I will be voting no on H.J. Res. 98.

I would like to ask Senator Cornyn if he would like to add anything to his comments, and if he has any suggestions for alternative solutions that could promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses. I believe that we can work together to find a solution that benefits everyone, and I am willing to listen to any ideas that my colleagues may have.

Steve Daines: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation in my state of Montana. The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a prime example of government overreach and would harm American businesses and workers.

I agree with my colleagues, such as Senators Cotton, Cramer, and Crapo, who argue that this rule would unfairly burden small businesses and franchises, leading to increased costs and reduced job creation. As a senator from Montana, I am committed to protecting the interests of our state's small businesses and entrepreneurs, who are the backbone of our economy.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Coons and Cortez Masto, argue that this rule is necessary to protect workers and promote fair labor practices. However, I believe that we can achieve this goal through other means that do not involve burdensome regulations. For example, we could work to strengthen existing labor laws and enforcement mechanisms, rather than creating new and unnecessary rules.

In response to Senator Cortez Masto's comments, I disagree with her assessment that this rule is necessary to protect workers. I believe that we can achieve this goal through other means that do not involve burdensome regulations. I also appreciate Senator Collins' willingness to listen to alternative solutions, and I believe that we can work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.

In conclusion, I will be voting yes on H.J. Res. 98, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. Let us stand up for American businesses and workers, and reject this unnecessary and burdensome regulation. As a senator from Montana, I believe that we can do better than this rule, and I will be voting yes on H.J. Res. 98.

Tammy Duckworth: I strongly disagree with my colleagues who are supporting this joint resolution. As a senator from Illinois, I believe that the National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a necessary protection for workers and a crucial step towards promoting fair labor practices.

The rule in question establishes a new joint employer standard that would hold companies accountable for the treatment of their employees, even if those employees are technically employed by a subcontractor or franchisee. This is a common practice in industries such as construction, hospitality, and agriculture, where workers are often employed by smaller companies that are contracted by larger corporations.

By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a step backwards and allowing companies to avoid responsibility for the treatment of their employees. This would be a disaster for workers, who would be left without protections and without recourse if they are mistreated on the job.

I understand that some of my colleagues are concerned about the potential impact on small businesses and franchises, but I believe that these concerns are overstated. The rule is designed to protect workers, not to burden businesses. And I believe that companies that treat their employees fairly and with respect will not be negatively impacted by this rule.

In fact, I think that this rule would actually benefit businesses in the long run, by promoting a more stable and productive workforce. When workers are treated fairly and with respect, they are more likely to be productive and loyal to their employers. And when companies prioritize the well-being of their employees, they are more likely to succeed in the long term.

I would like to respond to Senator Cotton's comments, and I disagree with his assessment that this rule is an example of government overreach.

Let us stand up for workers and promote fair labor practices, rather than allowing companies to avoid responsibility for the treatment of their employees. As a senator from Illinois, I believe that we can do better than this, and I will be voting no on H.J. Res. 98.

Joni Ernst: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation in my state of Iowa.

I'm committed to protecting the rights of workers in Pennsylvania and across the country, and I believe that this rule is an important step towards achieving that goal. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and to stand up for the rights of workers.

As for Senator Joe Manchin's decision to vote yes on H.J. Res. 98, I respect his willingness to consider the potential impact of this rule on small businesses and franchises.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Shaheen and Smith, are concerned about protecting workers' rights, and I share their commitment to ensuring that workers are treated fairly. However, I believe that this rule is not the right solution. Instead, we should be working to find alternative solutions that promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville, and I'm here to give my thoughts on H.J. Res. 98. As a Christian conservative, I believe in promoting economic growth and job creation, and I think this resolution is a step in the right direction.

The National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is an example of government overreach, and it's going to hurt small businesses and franchises in my state of Alabama. I've talked to folks back home, and they're telling me that this rule is going to increase their costs, make it harder for them to hire new employees, and stifle innovation.

I understand that some of my colleagues, like Senators Stabenow and Smith, are concerned about protecting workers' rights. And I share that concern. But I think this rule is not the right solution. Instead, we should be working to find alternative solutions that promote fair labor practices and protect workers' rights, while also supporting American businesses.

We must consider the long-term consequences of our actions and think carefully about the impact of this rule on small businesses and franchises.

To my colleagues who are opposed to this resolution, I'd say that I understand their concerns, but I think we need to take a closer look at the facts. This rule is not going to help workers; it's going to hurt them. It's going to lead to fewer jobs, lower wages, and less economic growth.

Let's stand up for American businesses and workers, and let's promote economic growth and job creation in our states. Let's reject this unnecessary and burdensome regulation, and let's find solutions that benefit everyone. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 98.

Chris Van Hollen: I strongly disagree with my colleagues who have spoken in favor of this joint resolution. As a senator from Maryland, I believe that the National Labor Relations Board's rule on joint employer status is a necessary step to protect workers' rights and promote fair labor practices.

The rule, which this resolution seeks to nullify, establishes a clear standard for determining when two employers are jointly responsible for the terms and conditions of employment. This is a critical issue, as many workers are employed by companies that use subcontractors, franchises, or other arrangements that can make it difficult to determine who is responsible for their working conditions.

By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a step backward and allowing companies to avoid their responsibilities to their workers. This would be a disaster for workers in Maryland and across the country, who would be left without the protections they deserve.

I understand that some of my colleagues are concerned about the impact of this rule on small businesses and franchises. But I believe that this concern is overstated. The rule is designed to ensure that companies are held accountable for their actions, and it does not impose undue burdens on small businesses or franchises.

In fact, the rule would help to level the playing field and ensure that all companies, regardless of their size or structure, are playing by the same rules. This would be a boon to workers and to the economy as a whole, as it would help to promote fair competition and prevent companies from exploiting their workers.

I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and to stand up for workers' rights. We should be working to strengthen our labor laws and protect workers, not weakening them and allowing companies to exploit their employees.

I will be voting no on H.J. Res. 98, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided resolution.

I believe that the rule is a necessary step to ensure that companies are held accountable for their actions, and that it does not impose undue burdens on small businesses or franchises.

In response to Senator Tillis, I would say that I understand his concerns about the impact of the rule on small businesses and franchises, but I believe that these concerns are overstated.

In response to Senator Tuberville, I would say that I respectfully disagree with his assessment of the rule.

Mark R. Warner: As I consider the joint resolution before us, H.J. Res. 98, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting economic growth and job creation in Virginia. However, I also believe in protecting workers' rights and ensuring that companies are held accountable for their actions.

I believe that the rule is a necessary step to ensure that companies are held accountable for their actions, and that it does not impose undue burdens on small businesses or franchises.

I also disagree with Senator Vance, who believes that this rule would have a devastating impact on small businesses and franchises. I think that this concern is unfounded, and that the rule would actually help to promote economic growth and job creation by ensuring that companies are held accountable for their actions and that workers are treated fairly.

Therefore, I will be voting no on H.J. Res. 98. I believe that this resolution is a misguided attempt to undermine workers' rights and promote the interests of large corporations. We should be working to strengthen our labor laws and protect workers, not weakening them and allowing companies to exploit their employees.

In fact, I believe that the rule would help to level the playing field and ensure that all companies are competing fairly. This would be a boon to workers and to the economy as a whole, as it would help to promote fair competition and prevent companies from exploiting their workers.

I would like to respond to Senator Van Hollen, who has spoken eloquently about the importance of protecting workers' rights. I agree with him that this rule is a necessary step to ensure that companies are held accountable for their actions, and that it does not impose undue burdens on small businesses or franchises.

I would also like to respond to Senator Warner, who has expressed concerns about the impact of this rule on small businesses and franchises.

As a senator from Indiana, I have seen the importance of standing up for the rights of small businesses and franchises. This rule would have a devastating impact on these entities, and I will not stand idly by while they are forced to bear the brunt of this misguided policy.

I agree with my Republican colleagues, such as Senators Wicker, Thune, Tillis, Tuberville, and Vance, who argue that this rule is an example of government overreach. I believe that the rule would stifle economic growth and job creation in Indiana, and I will do everything in my power to stop it.

I would like to respond to Senator Warren, who claimed that this rule would help to level the playing field and ensure that all companies are competing fairly. I disagree. This rule would actually create an uneven playing field, where small businesses and franchises are forced to comply with onerous regulations that their larger competitors can easily afford.

I also disagree with Senator Welch, who claimed that this rule would promote fair labor practices. I believe that this rule would actually lead to more confusion and uncertainty for workers and employers alike, and would ultimately harm the very people it is intended to help.

I will be voting yes on H.J. Res. 98. I believe that this resolution is a necessary step to protect the rights of small businesses and franchises in Indiana, and to promote economic growth and job creation in our state.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and to stand up for the rights of small businesses and franchises. We should be promoting economic growth and job creation, not undermining it with misguided regulations and policies. As a nation, we must prioritize the dignity and well-being of all workers, and ensure that they are treated with the respect and fairness they deserve. But we must also prioritize the rights of small businesses and franchises, and ensure that they are not forced to bear the brunt of government overreach.
