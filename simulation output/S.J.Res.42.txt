Tammy Baldwin: The bill before us today seeks to nullify a crucial policy update issued by the Food and Nutrition Service, which aims to protect individuals from discrimination based on their gender identity and sexual orientation. As a strong advocate for equality and human rights, I must express my deep concern and opposition to this joint resolution.

The policy update in question is a direct result of the landmark Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which reaffirmed that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It is our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that our policies and laws reflect this understanding and provide necessary protections for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.

By nullifying this policy update, we would be taking a significant step backward in our efforts to promote equality and inclusivity. It would undermine the progress we have made in recognizing the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals and would put them at risk of facing discrimination and marginalization.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have seen firsthand the importance of ensuring that our food and nutrition programs are accessible and inclusive for all individuals. This policy update is a critical step towards achieving that goal, and I strongly believe that we should be working to strengthen and expand these protections, not dismantling them.

I urge my colleagues to consider the far-reaching implications of this joint resolution and to join me in opposing it. We must stand together in support of equality, justice, and human rights for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.

I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in rejecting this attempt to undermine the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals.

John Barrasso: The bill before us today is a joint resolution that seeks to nullify a policy update issued by the Food and Nutrition Service, which aims to protect individuals from discrimination based on their gender identity and sexual orientation. As a senator from Wyoming, I have to consider the implications of this policy update on our state and our nation.

While I understand the concerns of my colleague, Senator Tammy Baldwin, I have to respectfully disagree with her assessment of this policy update. The policy update in question was issued by the Food and Nutrition Service without proper congressional review and approval, which is a clear overreach of executive authority. The Congressional Review Act is in place to ensure that Congress has a say in the rules and regulations that affect our nation, and in this case, the FNS failed to follow the proper procedures.

Furthermore, I believe that this policy update is an example of federal overreach into areas that are better left to the states. The issue of gender identity and sexual orientation is a complex and sensitive one, and it's not something that should be dictated by the federal government. Instead, we should be allowing states and local communities to make their own decisions about how to address these issues.

As a senator, I have a responsibility to protect the rights and interests of my constituents, and I believe that this policy update is not in the best interest of Wyoming or our nation. I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, as I believe it is necessary to nullify this policy update and ensure that Congress has a say in the rules and regulations that affect our nation.

I would like to address Senator Baldwin's concerns about the impact of this joint resolution on LGBTQ+ individuals. I understand that this is a sensitive issue, and I want to assure my colleague that my vote is not intended to be discriminatory or hurtful to any individual or group. However, I believe that this policy update is not the right solution to address the issues faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, and we should be working towards more comprehensive and inclusive solutions that take into account the concerns of all stakeholders.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, as I believe it is necessary to protect the rights and interests of my constituents and to ensure that Congress has a say in the rules and regulations that affect our nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and to work towards more comprehensive and inclusive solutions to address the issues faced by LGBTQ+ individuals.

Michael F. Bennet: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of the importance of protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. The policy update issued by the Food and Nutrition Service, which aims to protect individuals from discrimination based on their gender identity and sexual orientation, is a crucial step towards achieving that goal.

I agree with Senator Baldwin that nullifying this policy update would be a significant step backward in our efforts to promote equality and inclusivity. The Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County reaffirmed that sex discrimination includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and it is our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that our policies and laws reflect this understanding.

While I understand Senator Barrasso's concerns about executive overreach and the importance of congressional review, I believe that this policy update is a necessary step to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. The Congressional Review Act is an important tool for ensuring that Congress has a say in the rules and regulations that affect our nation, but in this case, I believe that the policy update is a reasonable interpretation of the law and is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock.

As a senator from Colorado, I have seen firsthand the importance of ensuring that our food and nutrition programs are accessible and inclusive for all individuals.

I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this attempt to undermine the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals. We must stand together in support of equality, justice, and human rights for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.

I would like to address Senator Barrasso's suggestion that this issue is better left to the states. While I understand the importance of state and local decision-making, I believe that this is a fundamental issue of human rights and dignity that requires a federal response. The patchwork of state laws and regulations that currently exist is often confusing and inconsistent, and it is our responsibility as federal lawmakers to ensure that all individuals are protected from discrimination, regardless of where they live.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals. We must work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society, and this policy update is an important step towards achieving that goal.

I would like to address the concerns raised by some of my colleagues that this policy update may be seen as an overreach of executive authority. I understand that concern, but I believe that the Food and Nutrition Service has the authority to issue this policy update under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

I understand that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the policy update being an example of federal overreach, but I believe that this is a matter of basic human dignity and respect.

I'd like to address the comments made by Senator Cramer, and I appreciate his commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals.

I will not stand idly by while we attempt to roll back the progress that we have made towards achieving equality and justice for all.

Richard J. Durbin: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the policy update issued by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) related to discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. As a senator who has long been committed to protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, including those in the LGBTQ+ community, I believe that this policy update is a crucial step towards achieving equality and justice for all.

The Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County made it clear that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is a form of sex discrimination, and it is our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that our policies reflect this reality. The policy update in question is a necessary step towards protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and ensuring that they have equal access to food and nutrition programs.

We cannot allow states and local communities to discriminate against individuals based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, and it is our responsibility to ensure that our policies reflect this.

I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the comments made by my colleagues, Senators Cramer, Crapo, Cruz, and Daines. Their arguments that this policy update is an example of federal overreach and that states and local communities should be allowed to make their own decisions about how to address these issues are misguided and ignore the reality of the discrimination that LGBTQ+ individuals face every day.

I would like to address the comments made by Senator Crapo, who stated that this policy update is not the right solution to address the issues faced by LGBTQ+ individuals. I respectfully disagree with his conclusion. This policy update is a necessary step towards achieving equality and justice for all, and it is our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that our policies reflect the reality of the discrimination that LGBTQ+ individuals face.

I would also like to respond to Senator Cruz, who stated that the issue of gender identity and sexual orientation is a complex one that requires a nuanced approach. I agree that this issue is complex, but I believe that the policy update in question is a necessary step towards protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. We cannot allow complexity to be an excuse for inaction, and we must work towards finding solutions that respect the rights and dignity of all individuals.

I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it. We should be working towards more comprehensive and inclusive solutions to address the issues faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, not trying to roll back the progress that we have made.

Joni Ernst: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of my commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, while also respecting the authority of Congress to review and approve rules and regulations. The policy update in question, which aims to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in certain FNS-enforced requirements, is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Cruz and Daines, who have expressed concerns about the policy update being an example of federal overreach into areas that are better left to the states. The issue of gender identity and sexual orientation is a sensitive one, and it's not something that should be dictated by the federal government. Instead, we should be allowing states and local communities to make their own decisions about how to address these issues.

I also believe that the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, while important, does not necessarily mean that we should be imposing a federal solution on the states. We should be respecting the authority of Congress to review and approve rules and regulations, and we should be working towards finding solutions that respect the rights and dignity of all individuals, while also respecting the authority of the states.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the policy update, I say that I understand their concerns, but I believe that this policy update is not the right solution to address the issues faced by LGBTQ+ individuals.

I will vote in favor of this joint resolution, as I believe it is necessary to nullify this policy update and ensure that Congress has a say in the rules and regulations that affect our nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and to work towards more comprehensive and inclusive solutions to address the issues faced by LGBTQ+ individuals.

To my colleagues, Senators Duckworth and Durbin, I respect your passion and commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, including those in the LGBTQ+ community.

I think this policy update is a necessary step towards achieving equality and justice for all, and it's our responsibility to ensure that our policies reflect the reality of the discrimination that LGBTQ+ individuals face.

Cindy Hyde-Smith: I'm afraid I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Senators Heinrich, Hickenlooper, and Hirono. As a senator from Mississippi, I have a deep commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, but I also believe that this policy update issued by the Food and Nutrition Service oversteps its authority and undermines the values of our nation.

The Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County was a significant step forward in protecting the rights of all individuals, but it did not explicitly address the issue of gender identity and sexual orientation in the context of FNS-enforced requirements. I believe that this policy update is an attempt to expand the scope of the Court's decision without proper congressional authority.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this policy update could have unintended consequences, such as infringing upon the rights of religious organizations and individuals who may hold differing views on these issues. As a nation, we must balance our commitment to protecting the rights of all individuals with our commitment to preserving the rights of conscience and religious freedom.

I will vote "yes" on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. We must ensure that our policies reflect the values and principles of our nation, and that we do not undermine the rights of any individual or group in the process.

Ron Johnson: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of my commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, but also to upholding the principles of federalism and the rule of law.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who believe that this policy update is necessary to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, I also believe that it is essential to ensure that any such policies are enacted through the proper legislative process, rather than through executive branch agencies. The Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County was a significant step forward in protecting the rights of all individuals, but it did not explicitly address the issue of gender identity and sexual orientation in the context of FNS-enforced requirements.

I am concerned that this policy update could be seen as an overreach of executive authority, and that it may have unintended consequences, such as infringing upon the rights of religious organizations and individuals who may hold differing views on these issues. As a nation, we must balance our commitment to protecting the rights of all individuals with our commitment to preserving the rights of conscience and religious freedom.

The policy update issued by the Food and Nutrition Service to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in certain FNS-enforced requirements is a necessary step forward in ensuring that all individuals have access to the same opportunities and protections under the law.

I strongly agree with my colleagues, Senators Hirono, Hoeven, and Kaine, who have expressed their opposition to this joint resolution. Nullifying this policy update would send a message that we are willing to tolerate discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, and that is unacceptable. The Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County was a significant step forward in protecting the rights of all individuals, and it is our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that our policies reflect the values of equality and justice that our nation was founded upon.

I understand the concerns of my colleagues who believe that this policy update is an overreach of executive authority, but I strongly disagree with their assessment. The Food and Nutrition Service has the authority to enforce the requirements under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and this policy update is a necessary step forward in ensuring that all individuals have access to the same opportunities and protections under the law.

In conclusion, I will vote "no" on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this measure.

The policy update issued by the Food and Nutrition Service to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in certain FNS-enforced requirements may have been well-intentioned, but I believe it is an overreach of executive authority.

Clayton County was a significant step forward in protecting the rights of all individuals, but it did not explicitly address the issue of gender identity and sexual orientation in the context of FNS-enforced requirements.

I am concerned that this policy update could have unintended consequences, such as infringing upon the rights of religious organizations and individuals who may hold differing views on these issues.
