Tammy Baldwin: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I am proud to announce that I will be voting in favor of repealing the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. This bill, introduced by my colleague Senator Tim Kaine, is a crucial step towards reasserting Congress's constitutional authority to declare war and ensuring that our military interventions are subject to rigorous oversight and debate.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always believed that our nation's military might should be used judiciously and with clear objectives. The authorizations for use of military force against Iraq, which were passed in 1991 and 2002, have been used to justify a wide range of military actions in the region, often without explicit congressional approval. This has led to a lack of transparency and accountability, and has undermined the democratic process.

By repealing these authorizations, we can help to prevent future presidents from unilaterally deploying our military without consulting Congress. This is not only a matter of constitutional principle, but also a matter of practical wisdom. Our military interventions should be subject to careful consideration and debate, with clear objectives and exit strategies.

I am also mindful of the fact that our military personnel have borne the brunt of these interventions, often with devastating consequences. As a nation, we owe it to them to ensure that their sacrifices are not taken lightly, and that we only put them in harm's way when absolutely necessary.

I want to commend Senator Kaine for his leadership on this issue, and I am proud to join him in supporting this bill. I urge my colleagues to join us in voting in favor of repealing the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq, and to work towards a more transparent and accountable foreign policy.

As for the various amendments that have been proposed, I believe that many of them are well-intentioned but misguided. Some have sought to add new conditions or certifications to the bill, which could undermine its core purpose. Others have attempted to expand the scope of the bill to include unrelated issues. I believe that we should focus on the core issue at hand, which is repealing the outdated and overly broad authorizations for use of military force against Iraq.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this bill because I believe that it is a necessary step towards reasserting Congress's constitutional authority and ensuring that our military interventions are subject to rigorous oversight and debate. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, and to work towards a more transparent and accountable foreign policy.

John Barrasso: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I must express my strong opposition to the bill introduced by Senator Tim Kaine to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq.

As a senator from Wyoming, I have always prioritized the safety and security of our nation, and I believe that this bill would put our military personnel and our allies at risk. The authorizations for use of military force against Iraq have been used to justify a range of military actions in the region, and repealing them would create a power vacuum that could be exploited by our enemies.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this bill would send a signal to our adversaries that we are weakening our commitment to regional security. At a time when Iran and other hostile actors are seeking to expand their influence in the Middle East, we should be strengthening our alliances and our military presence, not weakening them.

I also disagree with the assertion that our military interventions have been undertaken without explicit congressional approval. While it is true that the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq were passed in 1991 and 2002, they have been subject to regular review and debate by Congress. In fact, many of my colleagues and I have worked to ensure that our military actions are subject to rigorous oversight and scrutiny.

Regarding the comments made by Senator Tammy Baldwin, I respect her perspective, but I must respectfully disagree. While I share her commitment to transparency and accountability, I believe that this bill would have unintended consequences that would harm our national security. I also believe that many of the amendments proposed to this bill, including those that would add new conditions or certifications, are necessary to ensure that our military actions are subject to rigorous oversight and debate.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this bill because I believe that it would undermine our national security and create a power vacuum in the region. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and to work towards a more effective and sustainable foreign policy that prioritizes the safety and security of our nation.

Susan M. Collins: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I am considering the bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. After careful deliberation, I have decided to vote in favor of this bill.

As a senator from Maine, I have always believed that our nation's military might should be used judiciously and with clear objectives. The authorizations for use of military force against Iraq, which were passed in 1991 and 2002, have been used to justify a wide range of military actions in the region, often without explicit congressional approval. This has led to a lack of transparency and accountability, and has undermined the democratic process.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Shelley Moore Capito, Benjamin L. Cardin, Thomas R. Carper, and Robert P. Casey Jr., that our military personnel have borne the brunt of these interventions, often with devastating consequences. As a nation, we owe it to them to ensure that their sacrifices are not taken lightly, and that we only put them in harm's way when absolutely necessary.

I also appreciate the concerns expressed by some of my colleagues, including Senators John Barrasso and Marsha Blackburn, about the potential consequences of repealing these authorizations. However, I believe that repealing these authorizations is a necessary step towards reasserting Congress's constitutional authority and ensuring that our military interventions are subject to rigorous oversight and debate.

As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have seen firsthand the impact of our military interventions on our nation's economy and our global standing. I believe that repealing these authorizations will help to restore balance to our foreign policy and ensure that our military actions are aligned with our national interests.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of repealing these authorizations, I would like to say that I understand and respect their concerns. However, I believe that the benefits of repealing these authorizations far outweigh the potential risks. By repealing these authorizations, we can help to prevent future unauthorized military interventions and ensure that our military actions are subject to rigorous oversight and debate.

I would like to address the comments made by Senator Bill Cassidy, who expressed concerns that repealing these authorizations would undermine our national security and create a power vacuum in the region.

In particular, I am concerned that repealing these authorizations could limit our ability to respond to emerging threats in the region, including the ongoing presence of terrorist organizations. I believe that we must maintain the flexibility to respond to these threats, while also ensuring that our military actions are subject to congressional oversight and approval.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this bill because I believe that it is not in the best interest of our nation's security.

John Kennedy: The bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. Well, I've given it some thought, and I gotta say, I'm a "Nay" on this one. Now, I know some of my colleagues, like Senator Kaine, think it's high time we repealed these authorizations, but I just don't see it that way.

As a senator from Louisiana, I've got a strong sense of patriotism and a deep respect for our military. And I believe that repealing these authorizations without a clear plan for the future could put our national security at risk. I mean, think about it, folks. We're talking about a region that's still got a whole lot of instability, a whole lot of terrorist organizations running around. Do we really want to tie our hands behind our backs and limit our ability to respond to emerging threats?

Now, I know some of my colleagues, like Senator Gillibrand, Senator Hassan, and Senator Heinrich, think that repealing these authorizations is a necessary step towards ensuring that our military actions are subject to rigorous oversight and debate. And I get that. I really do. But I just don't think that's the right approach here.

I think we need to take a more cautious approach, make sure we've got a clear plan in place before we start repealing authorizations. I mean, we don't want to create a power vacuum in the region, do we? We don't want to give those terrorist organizations a chance to regroup and come after us again.

So, I'm gonna have to vote "Nay" on this one. I know it's not a popular opinion, but I think it's the right one. And I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of their actions and to work towards a more responsible and effective foreign policy that prioritizes the safety and security of our nation.

And let me tell you, I'm not alone in this thinking. Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, they've all expressed similar concerns about the potential consequences of repealing these authorizations without a clear plan for the future. So, I'm not some kind of outlier here. I'm just a senator who's trying to do what's right for our country.

So, that's my two cents on the matter. I hope my colleagues will consider my perspective and join me in voting "Nay" on this bill. Thank you.

As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I have had the opportunity to review this legislation and consider its implications.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who believe that these authorizations are outdated and no longer necessary, I strongly disagree. Repealing these authorizations without a clear plan for the future would be a mistake, and it would undermine our national security.

The fact that these authorizations were passed over two decades ago does not mean that they are no longer relevant. The threat posed by terrorist organizations and other adversaries in the region has not diminished, and our military must have the flexibility and authority to respond to emerging threats.

I am also concerned that repealing these authorizations would send the wrong signal to our allies and adversaries in the region. It would suggest that we are not committed to maintaining a strong and stable presence in the Middle East, and it would embolden our enemies.

I understand that some of my colleagues may believe that repealing these authorizations is a necessary step towards re-examining our military strategy and ensuring that our actions are aligned with our national interests. However, I believe that this approach is misguided.

Instead of repealing these authorizations, we should be working to update and refine them to ensure that they are consistent with our current national security needs. We should be providing our military with the authorities and resources they need to protect our nation's security, while also ensuring that our actions are subject to rigorous oversight and debate.

In conclusion, I will be voting "Nay" on the bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq.

They have been used to justify military actions that were not contemplated at the time of their passage, and they have contributed to a lack of transparency and accountability in our military interventions.

On the other hand, I share the concerns of Senators Sullivan, Risch, and Thune about the potential power vacuum in the region. Repealing these authorizations without a clear plan for the future could be irresponsible and potentially destabilizing for the region. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have seen firsthand the importance of a strong and effective military presence in the region.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote "Nay" on this bill.

I would like to ask Senator Kaine, the sponsor of this bill, to consider alternative approaches that would provide a clear plan for the future. What is the plan for ensuring that our military presence in the region is guided by a clear and nuanced understanding of our national interests? How will we prevent a power vacuum from forming, and how will we protect our troops and our nation from the potential consequences of repealing these authorizations?

I am willing to work with my colleagues to address any concerns they may have and to find a solution that works for everyone.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville, and I'm here to give you my thoughts on this bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. As a Christian conservative and a strong supporter of our military, I've got to say that I'm opposed to this bill.

I understand where Senators Kaine, Stabenow, and Tester are coming from, but I think they're wrong to say that these authorizations are outdated and no longer necessary. We've still got troops in the region, and we've still got a vested interest in keeping the peace and protecting our national security.

I agree with Senators Sullivan, Risch, and Thune that repealing these authorizations without a clear plan for the future would be irresponsible and potentially destabilizing for the region. We can't just pull out of Iraq without a thought for what might happen next. We've got to have a plan in place to ensure that our military presence is guided by a clear and nuanced understanding of our national interests.

Now, I know some of my colleagues are saying that we need to repeal these authorizations to prevent a perpetual state of war. But I say, what's wrong with being prepared to defend ourselves? What's wrong with having the authority to take action when necessary? We can't just sit back and wait for our enemies to make the first move. We've got to be proactive, and we've got to be strong.

So, I'll be voting "Nay" on this bill. I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term implications of this legislation and to work towards a more responsible and effective foreign policy that prioritizes the safety and security of our nation. We can't afford to take any risks when it comes to our national security, and I won't support any bill that puts our troops or our nation at risk.

To Senator Kaine, I'd say that I appreciate your efforts to address this issue, but I think you're going about it the wrong way. Instead of repealing these authorizations, let's work on finding a more responsible and effective approach to our foreign policy. Let's make sure that our military presence is guided by a clear and nuanced understanding of our national interests, and let's make sure that we're always working towards a more peaceful and stable world.

But for now, I'm a "Nay" on this bill. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this legislation and in working towards a more responsible and effective foreign policy.
