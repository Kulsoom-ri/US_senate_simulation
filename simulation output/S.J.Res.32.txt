Tammy Baldwin: I rise today to express my strong opposition to S.J. Res. 32, a joint resolution that seeks to nullify the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. This rule is a crucial step forward in promoting transparency and fairness in lending practices, and I believe it is essential that we allow it to move forward.

The rule requires financial institutions to collect and report credit application data for small businesses, which will help to identify and address potential disparities in lending practices. This is a common-sense measure that will help to ensure that small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities, have equal access to credit and opportunities to grow and thrive.

I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the President has chosen to veto this resolution. However, I believe that it is our duty as lawmakers to stand up for the interests of our constituents and to protect the integrity of our financial system.

I will be voting against overriding the President's veto, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important rule. We must prioritize the needs of small businesses and the communities they serve, rather than catering to the interests of large financial institutions.

I would like to address the concerns that have been raised about the potential burden on small financial institutions. While I understand that there may be some additional costs associated with implementing this rule, I believe that these costs are far outweighed by the benefits of increased transparency and fairness in lending practices.

Furthermore, I would like to note that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has already taken steps to minimize the burden on small financial institutions, including providing exemptions for certain types of loans and allowing for a phased-in implementation of the rule.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that S.J. Res. 32 is a misguided attempt to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's efforts to promote fairness and transparency in lending practices. I will be voting against overriding the President's veto, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important rule.

John Barrasso: As I stand here today, I strongly support overriding the President's veto of S.J. Res. 32. This joint resolution is a crucial step in protecting small businesses and financial institutions from the overreach of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The rule in question, which requires financial institutions to collect and report credit application data for small businesses, is a burdensome and unnecessary regulation that will only serve to increase costs and reduce access to credit for the very businesses it claims to help. I've spoken to numerous small financial institutions in Wyoming, and they've expressed their deep concerns about the potential impact of this rule on their ability to operate efficiently and effectively.

My colleague, Senator Baldwin, has argued that this rule is necessary to promote transparency and fairness in lending practices. However, I believe that this rule is a classic example of government overreach, and it will only serve to stifle the growth and development of small businesses.

I'd like to address Senator Baldwin's point about the potential benefits of this rule for women- and minority-owned businesses. While I agree that these businesses are crucial to our economy, I don't believe that this rule is the right way to support them. In fact, I think it's likely to have the opposite effect, by increasing the regulatory burden on small financial institutions and making it harder for them to lend to these businesses.

I'll be voting in favor of overriding the President's veto, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution. We must stand up for the interests of small businesses and financial institutions, and reject this misguided attempt to impose unnecessary and burdensome regulations on them.

To Senator Baldwin, I would say that while I understand her concerns about fairness and transparency in lending practices, I believe that this rule is not the right solution. Instead, we should be working to find ways to support small businesses and promote economic growth, rather than imposing unnecessary regulations that will only serve to hinder their development.

Michael F. Bennet: As I consider the override of the President's veto on S.J. Res. 32, I must weigh the competing interests and arguments presented by my colleagues. Senator Baldwin has made a compelling case for the importance of promoting transparency and fairness in lending practices, particularly for small businesses owned by women and minorities. I agree that the rule in question has the potential to identify and address potential disparities in lending practices, which is a crucial step forward in promoting economic equality.

However, I also understand the concerns raised by Senator Barrasso and other colleagues about the potential burden on small financial institutions. As a senator from Colorado, I have seen firsthand the importance of small businesses and community lenders in driving economic growth and development. I am concerned that the rule may impose unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens on these institutions, which could ultimately harm the very businesses it aims to help.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against overriding the President's veto. While I believe that the intentions behind the rule are laudable, I am not convinced that it is the right solution to the problem. Instead, I think we should be working to find ways to support small businesses and promote economic growth, rather than imposing unnecessary regulations that may have unintended consequences.

I would like to propose an alternative approach that balances the need for transparency and fairness in lending practices with the need to support small financial institutions. Perhaps we could explore exemptions or phased-in implementation for small financial institutions, or provide additional resources and support to help them comply with the rule. By working together and finding a more nuanced solution, I believe we can promote economic growth and equality while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

To Senator Baldwin, I appreciate your passion and commitment to promoting fairness and transparency in lending practices. I share your concerns about the potential impact of this rule on women- and minority-owned businesses, and I am willing to work with you to find alternative solutions that address these concerns.

To Senator Barrasso, I understand your concerns about the potential burden on small financial institutions, and I agree that we must be careful not to impose unnecessary regulations that may harm these institutions. However, I also believe that we must be mindful of the potential consequences of inaction, and work to find solutions that promote economic growth and equality while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

In conclusion, I will be voting against overriding the President's veto, but I am committed to working with my colleagues to find alternative solutions that promote economic growth, equality, and transparency in lending practices.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Brown, Butler, and Cardin, have argued that this rule is necessary to promote transparency and fairness in lending practices, particularly for women- and minority-owned businesses. However, I believe that this rule is not the right way to support these businesses. In fact, I think it's likely to have the opposite effect, by increasing the regulatory burden on small financial institutions and making it harder for them to lend to these businesses.

I appreciate the comments made by my colleagues, such as Senator Budd and Senator Capito, who have also expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on small businesses and financial institutions. I agree with them that we should be working to find alternative solutions that promote economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

As a member of the Senate, I will be voting in favor of overriding the President's veto. I believe that this rule is a misguided attempt to impose unnecessary and burdensome regulations on small financial institutions, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is rejected. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of overriding the President's veto and rejecting this misguided rule. Let us work together to find solutions that promote economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

I will vote "yay" on the motion to override the President's veto.

Susan M. Collins: As I consider the override of the President's veto on S.J. Res. 32, I must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. While I understand the concerns raised by some of my colleagues about the potential burden on small financial institutions, I believe that the benefits of this rule in promoting transparency and fairness in lending practices outweigh the costs.

As a senator from Maine, I have always prioritized the interests of small businesses and the economy. I believe that this rule is a necessary step forward in ensuring that small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities, have equal access to credit and opportunities to grow and thrive.

I appreciate the comments made by Senators Brown, Butler, and Cardin, who have argued that this rule is necessary to identify and address potential disparities in lending practices. I agree with them that the benefits of this rule far outweigh the costs, and that it is a necessary step in promoting fairness and transparency in lending practices.

However, I also understand the concerns raised by Senators Capito, Cassidy, and others about the potential impact of this rule on small financial institutions. I believe that it is essential to find a balance between promoting fairness and transparency in lending practices and avoiding unnecessary regulatory burdens on small financial institutions.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against overriding the President's veto. I believe that this rule is a crucial step forward in promoting fairness and transparency in lending practices, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is allowed to move forward.

I will vote "nay" on the motion to override the President's veto.

I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the potential burden on small financial institutions, but I believe that the benefits of this rule far outweigh the costs. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has already taken steps to minimize the burden on small financial institutions, including providing exemptions for certain types of loans and allowing for a phased-in implementation of the rule.

As a senator who has always prioritized the interests of small businesses and the economy, I believe that this rule is a necessary step in promoting fairness and transparency in lending practices.

We must prioritize the needs of small businesses and the communities they serve, rather than catering to the interests of large financial institutions.

Tom Cotton: I rise today to express my strong support for overriding the President's veto of S.J. Res. 32. This joint resolution nullifies the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which I believe is a burdensome and unnecessary regulation that will harm small businesses and financial institutions in my home state of Arkansas.

As a senator who has always prioritized the interests of small businesses and the economy, I am deeply concerned about the potential impact of this rule on the ability of small financial institutions to operate efficiently and effectively.

Tammy Duckworth: I rise today to express my strong opposition to overriding the President's veto of S.J. Res. 32. As a senator who has always prioritized the interests of consumers and small businesses, I believe that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a necessary and important regulation that will help to promote fairness and transparency in the lending process.

The rule requires financial institutions to collect and report credit application data for small businesses, which will help to identify and address potential disparities in lending practices.

I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the potential impact of this rule on small financial institutions, but I believe that these concerns are overstated. The rule is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and it provides exemptions for small institutions that may not have the resources to comply.

Furthermore, I am concerned that overriding the President's veto would send a signal that we are not committed to protecting the interests of consumers and small businesses. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created to ensure that financial institutions are held accountable for their actions, and that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive practices.

John Fetterman: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a crucial step towards promoting fairness and transparency in the lending process.

This rule will help identify and address potential disparities in lending practices, ensuring that all small businesses have an equal shot at success.

I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the potential impact of this rule on small financial institutions. However, I believe that these concerns are overstated. The rule is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and it provides exemptions for small institutions that may not have the resources to comply.

I'm disappointed, but not surprised, to see my Republican colleagues trying to override the President's veto and undermine this important rule.

As a senator who has always prioritized the interests of small businesses and the economy, I am deeply concerned about the potential impact of this rule on the ability of small financial institutions to operate efficiently and effectively. I believe that we should be working to find alternative solutions that promote economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Ernst, Fischer, and others, who have raised concerns about the potential impact of this rule on small financial institutions. I believe that we should be working to find alternative solutions that promote economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule is a classic example of government overreach, and it will only serve to stifle the growth and development of small businesses. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of overriding the President's veto and rejecting this misguided rule.

I will vote "yay" on the motion to override the President's veto. Let us work together to find solutions that promote economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

To my colleagues who are opposing the override, I say that we cannot let the interests of large financial institutions and bureaucrats in Washington dictate the fate of small businesses and financial institutions in our states. We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and financial institutions, and reject this rule.

I am proud to stand with my colleagues, Senators Ernst, Fischer, and others, who are fighting to protect the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

Chuck Grassley: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a prime example of government overreach. As a senator from Iowa, I've seen firsthand how burdensome regulations can stifle the growth and development of small businesses.

I'm disappointed, but not surprised, to see some of my colleagues opposing the override of the President's veto. It's clear that they're more interested in protecting the interests of big banks and financial institutions than in standing up for small businesses and consumers.

Margaret Wood Hassan: As I consider the override of the President's veto on S.J. Res. 32, I am reminded of the importance of protecting the interests of consumers and small businesses in my home state of New Hampshire.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a necessary and important regulation that will help to identify and address potential disparities in lending practices. This is a critical step towards ensuring that small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities, have equal access to credit and are not subjected to discriminatory lending practices.

I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the potential impact of this rule on small financial institutions, but I believe that these concerns are overstated. The rule is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and it provides exemptions for small institutions that may not have the resources to comply.

Furthermore, I am concerned that overriding the President's veto would send a signal that we are not committed to protecting the interests of consumers and small businesses. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created to ensure that financial institutions are held accountable for their actions, and that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive practices.

John Kennedy: The debate on S.J. Res. 32 has been lively, to say the least. As the sponsor of this joint resolution, I'd like to remind my colleagues that this is about one thing: stopping the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's overreach. Their rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a classic example of government bureaucracy run amok.

I've heard some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that this rule is necessary to promote fairness and transparency in lending practices.

After careful consideration, I have to say that I'm concerned about the potential impact of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. While I understand the intention behind the rule, I believe it could lead to unintended consequences, such as increased costs and reduced access to credit for small businesses.

As someone who has worked to promote economic growth and equality, I'm worried that this rule could stifle the very businesses we're trying to help. I agree with my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, that we should be cautious about imposing burdensome regulations on small financial institutions.

At the same time, I also understand the concerns raised by Senators Kaine, Gillibrand, and others about the importance of promoting fairness and transparency in lending practices. I believe we can find alternative solutions that achieve these goals without overregulating our economy.

I urge my colleagues to work together to find solutions that promote economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and consumers. Let's find a way to balance our desire to promote fairness and transparency with the need to avoid overregulation and promote economic growth.

As I always say, "the best engine for a just society is free enterprise." Let's make sure we're not stifling that engine with unnecessary regulations. I'll be voting to override the President's veto, and I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.

I urge my colleagues to stand with me in supporting the override and to work together to find solutions that promote economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

To my colleagues who are opposing the override, I say that we cannot let the interests of big government and bureaucrats in Washington dictate the fate of small businesses and financial institutions in our states.

Ben Ray Lujan: As I consider the override of the President's veto on S.J. Res. 32, I am reminded of the importance of protecting the interests of consumers and small businesses in my home state of New Mexico. After careful consideration, I must say that I strongly agree with the comments made by Senators Mark Kelly, Amy Klobuchar, and others, who have raised important points about the need to promote fairness and transparency in lending practices.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a necessary and important regulation that will help to identify and address potential disparities in lending practices. This is a critical step towards ensuring that small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities, have equal access to credit and are not subjected to discriminatory lending practices.

As a senator who has worked tirelessly to support small businesses and entrepreneurs in New Mexico, I believe that this rule is a crucial step towards creating a more just and equitable economy. I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the potential impact of this rule on small financial institutions, but I believe that these concerns are overstated. The rule is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and it provides exemptions for small institutions that may not have the resources to comply.

Furthermore, I am concerned that overriding the President's veto would send a signal that we are not committed to protecting the interests of consumers and small businesses. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created to ensure that financial institutions are held accountable for their actions, and that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive practices.

I will vote "nay" on the motion to override the President's veto. I believe that this rule is an important step towards promoting economic justice and equality, and I will not support efforts to undermine it.

To my colleagues who are supporting the override, I say that we cannot let the interests of big banks and financial institutions dictate the fate of small businesses and consumers.

I will not support efforts to undermine it.

Cynthia M. Lummis: The debate on S.J. Res. 32 has indeed been lively, and I appreciate the passion from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As a senator from Wyoming, I have always been committed to promoting economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and financial institutions.

After careful consideration, I must say that I strongly agree with the comments made by Senators John Kennedy, Josh Hawley, John Hoeven, and Cindy Hyde-Smith, who have raised important points about the need to prevent government overreach and promote economic growth. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a classic example of government bureaucracy run amok. This rule is a solution in search of a problem, and it will only serve to increase costs and reduce access to credit for small businesses.

As a senator who has worked tirelessly to support small businesses and entrepreneurs in Wyoming, I believe that this rule will have a disproportionate impact on our state's economy. I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the potential impact of this rule on consumer protection, but I believe that these concerns are overstated. We already have laws on the books to prevent discriminatory lending practices, and this rule is not necessary to protect consumers. It will only serve to stifle the growth and development of small businesses.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in opposing the override and to work together to find solutions that promote economic growth and equality, while also protecting the interests of small businesses and consumers.

I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the potential impact of this rule on small financial institutions, but I believe that these concerns are overstated. The rule is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and it provides exemptions for small institutions that may not have the resources to comply.

Rand Paul: I rise today to express my strong opposition to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As a senator from Kentucky, I have always been committed to promoting economic growth and reducing the burden of government regulations on small businesses.

I believe that this rule is a classic example of government overreach, and it will only serve to increase costs and reduce access to credit for small businesses. The rule requires financial institutions to collect and report data on small business lending, which will be a significant burden on small banks and credit unions. This will lead to increased costs for these institutions, which will ultimately be passed on to consumers.

I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the potential impact of this rule on small businesses owned by women and minorities. However, I believe that this rule is not the solution to addressing these disparities. Instead, we should be focusing on reducing the regulatory burden on all small businesses, regardless of their ownership.

I will vote "yay" on the motion to override the President's veto. I believe that this rule is a misguided attempt to address a problem that does not exist, and it will only serve to harm the very small businesses that we are trying to help.

Roger F. Wicker: I rise today to express my strong support for overriding the President's veto of S.J. Res. 32, a joint resolution that nullifies the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As a senator from Mississippi, I have seen firsthand the struggles that small businesses and entrepreneurs face in accessing capital and growing their businesses.

While I understand the concerns raised by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I firmly believe that this rule is an example of government overreach and would impose unnecessary burdens on small financial institutions. The rule requires financial institutions to collect and report credit application data for small businesses, which would be a costly and time-consuming process. This would disproportionately affect small banks and credit unions, which are already struggling to compete with larger financial institutions.

I also believe that this rule would stifle economic growth and limit access to credit for small businesses, particularly those in rural areas. As a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I have worked tirelessly to support small businesses and entrepreneurs in Mississippi, and I believe that this rule would undermine those efforts.

I respectfully disagree with my colleagues who argue that this rule is necessary to address disparities in lending practices. While I agree that disparities exist, I believe that this rule is not the solution. Instead, we should be working to promote economic growth and equality through other means, such as reducing regulatory burdens and increasing access to capital for small businesses.

Tammy Duckworth: I rise today to express my strong opposition to overriding the President's veto of S.J. Res. 32.

As a senator from Illinois, I have seen firsthand the importance of access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved communities. This rule would require financial institutions to collect and report credit application data for small businesses, which would help to identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent these businesses from accessing the capital they need to grow and thrive.

I strongly disagree with my Republican colleagues who claim that this rule is an example of government overreach.

This rule would impose significant burdens on small financial institutions, requiring them to collect and report credit application data for small businesses. This would be a costly and time-consuming process, disproportionately affecting small banks and credit unions, which are already struggling to compete with larger financial institutions. I believe that this rule would undermine the efforts of small businesses to access capital and stifle economic growth.

While I understand the concerns raised by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about disparities in lending practices, I believe that this rule is not the solution. Instead, we should be working to promote economic growth and equality through other means, such as reducing regulatory burdens and increasing access to capital for small businesses.

I agree with my Republican colleagues, such as Senators Ernst, Fischer, and Graham, who have raised points about the need to prevent government overreach and promote economic growth by overturning this rule. I also appreciate the comments made by Senator Hagerty, who has highlighted the importance of protecting the interests of small businesses and consumers.

I will vote "yea" on the motion to override the President's veto, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort. We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and reject this misguided attempt to impose unnecessary regulations on our financial institutions.

In response to my colleagues who are opposing the override, I say: let us not forget that we are here to represent the people, not just the special interests. We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and reject this misguided attempt to undermine the economic growth and prosperity of our great nation. I believe that this rule is a step in the wrong direction, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is overturned.

Martin Heinrich: I rise today to express my strong opposition to overriding the President's veto of S.J. Res. 32. As a senator from New Mexico, I have seen firsthand the importance of access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved communities. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a crucial step towards addressing the disparities in lending practices that have plagued our economy for far too long.

I strongly disagree with my Republican colleagues who claim that this rule is an example of government overreach. In reality, this rule is a necessary step towards promoting economic growth and equality by ensuring that small businesses have a fair shot at accessing the capital they need to compete. The data collection and reporting requirements imposed by this rule will help to identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent small businesses from accessing the capital they need to grow and thrive.

I also take issue with the claim that this rule would impose significant burdens on small financial institutions. While it is true that collecting and reporting credit application data may require some additional resources, I believe that the benefits of this rule far outweigh the costs. The long-term benefits of increased transparency and accountability in small business lending practices will ultimately lead to a more equitable and prosperous economy for all.

Furthermore, I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues are prioritizing the interests of big banks and financial institutions over those of small businesses and consumers. We should be working to promote economic growth and equality, not undermining the efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect the rights of small businesses and consumers.

I will continue to fight for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that this rule is upheld.

We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and reject this misguided attempt to impose unnecessary regulations on our financial institutions. I will vote "yea" on the motion to override the President's veto, and I hope that my colleagues will do the same.

Let's send a message to the American people that we're committed to promoting economic growth, reducing regulatory burdens, and protecting the rights of small businesses and consumers. Let's override this veto and put an end to this ill-conceived rule once and for all.

Joe Manchin III: As I consider the override of the President's veto on S.J. Res. 32, I am reminded of the importance of balancing the need to protect small businesses and consumers with the need to prevent government overreach. After careful consideration, I must say that I strongly agree with the comments made by my Republican colleagues, such as Senators Kennedy, Lankford, and Lee, who have raised points about the need to prevent government overreach and promote economic growth by overturning this rule.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a perfect example of bureaucratic overreach. It would impose significant burdens on small financial institutions, requiring them to collect and report credit application data for small businesses. This would be a costly and time-consuming process, disproportionately affecting small banks and credit unions, which are already struggling to compete with larger financial institutions.

Rand Paul: The debate on S.J. Res. 32 has been quite lively, with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle presenting their arguments. As I consider the override of the President's veto, I must say that I strongly agree with the comments made by Senator Kennedy, who introduced this joint resolution. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a prime example of government overreach and bureaucratic red tape.

As a senator from Kentucky, I have seen firsthand the importance of reducing regulatory burdens and promoting economic growth. This rule, which requires financial institutions to collect and report credit application data for small businesses, is a perfect example of the kind of unnecessary and costly regulation that stifles innovation and job creation.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Murkowski, Murphy, Murray, Ossoff, and Padilla, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of overturning this rule on small businesses and consumers. However, I believe that their concerns are misplaced. The data collection and reporting requirements imposed by this rule will only serve to increase the costs and burdens on small financial institutions, which will ultimately be passed on to consumers.

I also take issue with the claim that this rule is necessary to promote economic growth and equality. The fact is, this rule is a solution in search of a problem. There is no evidence to suggest that small businesses are being disproportionately affected by lending practices, and even if there were, this rule would not be an effective solution.

As a libertarian, I believe in reducing the size and scope of government, and promoting individual freedom and responsibility. This rule is a perfect example of the kind of government overreach that I am committed to fighting against.

Gary C. Peters: As I consider the override of the President's veto on S.J. Res. 32, I am reminded of the importance of protecting small businesses and consumers in my home state of Michigan. After careful consideration, I must say that I strongly disagree with the comments made by my Republican colleagues, such as Senators Kennedy, Lankford, and Lee, who have raised points about the need to prevent government overreach and promote economic growth by overturning this rule.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a crucial step towards addressing the disparities in lending practices that have plagued our economy for far too long. I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards promoting economic growth and equality by ensuring that small businesses have a fair shot at accessing the capital they need to compete. The data collection and reporting requirements imposed by this rule will help to identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent small businesses from accessing the capital they need to grow and thrive.

As a senator from Michigan, I have seen firsthand the importance of access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs, particularly those in rural areas. I believe that this rule is a step in the right direction, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is upheld.

I take issue with the claim that this rule would impose significant burdens on small financial institutions. While it is true that collecting and reporting credit application data may require some additional resources, I believe that the benefits of this rule far outweigh the costs. The long-term benefits of increased transparency and accountability in small business lending practices will ultimately lead to a more equitable and prosperous economy for all.

I will vote "nay" on the motion to override the President's veto, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort. We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and reject this misguided attempt to undermine the economic growth and prosperity of our great nation.

I appreciate the comments made by Senators Murray, Ossoff, and Padilla, who have highlighted the importance of promoting economic growth and equality through this rule. As a senator who has always championed the interests of small businesses and consumers, I believe that this rule is a step in the right direction, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is upheld.

I would like to address Senator Paul's comments, who claimed that this rule is an example of bureaucratic overreach. I disagree with his assessment, and I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards promoting economic growth and equality. I would like to remind him that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency that is tasked with protecting consumers and promoting fair lending practices. This rule is a crucial step towards achieving that goal, and I will not support any efforts to undermine the agency's authority.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting "nay" on the motion to override the President's veto. We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and support the efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect them. Together, we can create a more equitable and prosperous economy for all.

After careful consideration, I must say that I strongly agree with the comments made by my Republican colleagues, such as Senators Kennedy, Lankford, and Lee, who have raised points about the need to prevent government overreach and promote economic growth by overturning this rule.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a prime example of government overreach and bureaucratic red tape. As a senator from South Carolina, I have seen firsthand the importance of reducing regulatory burdens and promoting economic growth. This rule, which requires financial institutions to collect and report credit application data for small businesses, is a perfect example of the kind of unnecessary and costly regulation that stifles innovation and job creation.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Rosen, Sanders, and Schatz, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of overturning this rule on small businesses and consumers. However, I believe that their concerns are misplaced. The data collection and reporting requirements imposed by this rule will only serve to increase the costs and burdens on small financial institutions, which will ultimately be passed on to consumers.

As a conservative and a former small business owner, I believe in reducing the size and scope of government, and promoting individual freedom and responsibility. This rule is a perfect example of the kind of government overreach that I am committed to fighting against.

Therefore, I will vote "yea" on the motion to override the President's veto, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort. We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and reject this misguided attempt to impose more bureaucratic red tape on our economy.

In response to my colleagues who are opposing the override, I say: let us not forget that we are here to represent the people, not just the special interests. We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and support the efforts of Senator Kennedy to reduce regulatory burdens and promote economic growth. I appreciate the comments made by Senators Rounds and Rubio, who have highlighted the importance of reducing government overreach and promoting economic freedom. As a senator who has always championed the interests of small businesses and consumers, I believe that this rule is a step in the wrong direction, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is overturned.

Jeanne Shaheen: The debate on S.J. Res. 32 has been quite lively, with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle presenting their arguments.

I strongly disagree with the comments made by my Republican colleagues, such as Senators Kennedy, Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, who have raised points about the need to prevent government overreach and promote economic growth by overturning this rule. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on small business lending under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is a crucial step towards addressing the disparities in lending practices that have plagued our economy for far too long.

I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards promoting economic growth and equality by ensuring that small businesses have a fair shot at accessing the capital they need to compete. The data collection and reporting requirements imposed by this rule will help to identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent small businesses from accessing the capital they need to grow and thrive.

As a senator from New Hampshire, I have seen firsthand the importance of access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved communities. I believe that this rule is a step in the right direction, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it is upheld.

I take issue with the claim that this rule would impose significant burdens on small financial institutions. While it is true that collecting and reporting credit application data may require some additional resources, I believe that the benefits of this rule far outweigh the costs. The long-term benefits of increased transparency and accountability in small business lending practices will ultimately lead to a more equitable and prosperous economy for all.

In response to my colleagues who are supporting the override, I say: let us not forget that we are here to represent the people, not just the special interests. We must stand up for the rights of small businesses and consumers, and support the efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect them.

I will vote "nay" on the motion to override the President's veto, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort.
