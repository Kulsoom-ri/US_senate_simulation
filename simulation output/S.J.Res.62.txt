Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) that allows for the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay into the United States under certain conditions. As a senator from Wisconsin, a state with a significant agricultural sector, I have carefully considered the implications of this rule and the potential risks it may pose to our domestic beef industry and animal health.

While I understand the desire to expand trade opportunities and support the economy of Paraguay, I have concerns about the potential risks of introducing foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) into the United States. FMD is a highly contagious and devastating disease that could have significant economic and animal health impacts on our country.

The conditions outlined in the APHIS rule, such as requiring that FMD has not been diagnosed in the exporting region within the previous 12 months and that the meat originated from premises where FMD has not been present, are important safeguards. However, I am not convinced that these measures are sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with importing fresh beef from Paraguay.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have worked to support the interests of American farmers and ranchers, including those in Wisconsin's dairy and beef industries. I am committed to ensuring that any trade agreements or rules do not compromise the health and safety of our domestic animal populations or the economic viability of our agricultural sector.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the APHIS rule. I believe that it is essential to prioritize the health and safety of our domestic animal populations and the economic interests of American farmers and ranchers. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and protecting the integrity of our food system.

John Barrasso: As a senator from Wyoming, a state with a significant ranching industry, I have to consider the potential impacts of this joint resolution on our domestic beef industry and animal health. While I understand the concerns about foot-and-mouth disease, I believe that the conditions outlined in the APHIS rule are sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with importing fresh beef from Paraguay.

I've reviewed the risk analysis conducted by APHIS, and I'm convinced that the measures in place, such as requiring that FMD has not been diagnosed in the exporting region within the previous 12 months and that the meat originated from premises where FMD has not been present, are robust enough to protect our domestic animal populations.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I've also considered the broader implications of this rule on our trade relationships and the economy of Paraguay. I believe that expanding trade opportunities and supporting the economy of Paraguay can have positive benefits for both our countries.

I respectfully disagree with my colleague, Senator Baldwin, on this issue. While I understand her concerns about the potential risks, I believe that the benefits of allowing the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay under certain conditions outweigh the risks.

Therefore, I will be voting against the joint resolution to nullify the APHIS rule. I believe that it's essential to support the expansion of trade opportunities and the growth of our domestic beef industry, while also ensuring the health and safety of our animal populations.

I urge my colleagues to consider the broader implications of this rule and to support the expansion of trade opportunities that can benefit both our country and Paraguay.

I hope that we can continue to work together to find a solution that balances the need to protect our domestic animal populations with the need to support American farmers and ranchers.

My vote is: Yea.

Mitch McConnell: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the APHIS rule allowing the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay, I am reminded of the importance of prioritizing the health and safety of our domestic animal populations and the economic interests of American farmers and ranchers. As a senator from Kentucky, I have seen the significant impact that the agricultural sector has on our state's economy, particularly in the rural areas.

While I understand the desire to expand trade opportunities and support the economy of Paraguay, I share the concerns of many of my colleagues about the potential risks of introducing foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) into the United States. The conditions outlined in the APHIS rule, such as requiring that FMD has not been diagnosed in the exporting region within the previous 12 months and that the meat originated from premises where FMD has not been present, are important safeguards, but I am not convinced that they are sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with importing fresh beef from Paraguay.

As a strong supporter of American agriculture, I believe it's crucial to protect the integrity of our food system and the livelihoods of our farmers and ranchers. I agree with Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, Johnson, and others that it's essential to prioritize the health and safety of our domestic animal populations and the economic interests of American farmers and ranchers.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential benefits of expanding trade opportunities with Paraguay, I understand their perspective, but I believe that the risks associated with importing fresh beef from Paraguay outweigh any potential benefits. As a senator from Kentucky, I have a responsibility to protect the interests of our farmers and ranchers, and I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule is the best course of action to ensure their safety and security.

I appreciate the comments from my colleagues, including Senators Lankford, Lummis, and Manchin, who share my concerns about the potential risks and benefits of importing fresh beef from Paraguay. I also appreciate the thoughtful consideration of Senators Lujan, Markey, and others who have expressed a different perspective on this issue.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the APHIS rule. I believe that it's crucial to protect the integrity of our food system and the livelihoods of our farmers and ranchers. My vote is: Yea.

Robert Menendez: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the APHIS rule allowing the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay, I am reminded of the importance of prioritizing the health and safety of our domestic animal populations and the economic interests of American farmers and ranchers. As a senator from New Jersey, I have seen the significant impact that the agricultural sector has on our state's economy, particularly in the rural areas.

I agree with Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, Johnson, and others that it's essential to prioritize the health and safety of our domestic animal populations and the economic interests of American farmers and ranchers.

However, I also believe that we should consider the potential benefits of expanding trade opportunities with Paraguay and the potential impact on the economy of New Jersey. As a representative of a state with a significant agricultural industry, I believe it is crucial to balance the need to protect our domestic animal populations with the need to support American farmers and ranchers who export beef to other countries.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the joint resolution to nullify the APHIS rule. I believe that the APHIS rule provides sufficient safeguards to mitigate the risks associated with importing fresh beef from Paraguay, and that nullifying the rule could harm the economic interests of American farmers and ranchers who export beef to other countries.

I appreciate the comments from my colleagues, including Senators Kaine, King, Klobuchar, and Lujan, who share my concerns about the potential risks and benefits of importing fresh beef from Paraguay. I hope that we can continue to work together to find a solution that balances the need to protect our domestic animal populations with the need to support American farmers and ranchers.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential risks of importing fresh beef from Paraguay, I understand their perspective, but I believe that we should not let fear dictate our decision-making process. Instead, we should rely on science and data to inform our decisions. The APHIS rule is based on a thorough risk analysis, and I believe that it provides a reasonable framework for importing fresh beef from Paraguay.

My vote is: Nay.

(approved) - Original tweet is a non-rumor, so no need to debunk.

Jerry Moran: The bill before us today, introduced by Senator Tester, seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regarding the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay. As a senator from Kansas, a state with a significant agricultural industry, I have given this issue careful consideration.

While I understand the concerns about the potential risks of importing beef from Paraguay, I believe that the conditions set forth by APHIS are reasonable and necessary to ensure the safety of our food supply. The risk analysis conducted by APHIS concluded that fresh beef could be safely imported from Paraguay, provided that certain conditions are met, including the absence of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the exporting region and regular inspections of slaughter facilities.

I also appreciate the efforts of Senator Tester and the cosponsors of this bill to address the concerns of American ranchers and farmers. However, I am not convinced that nullifying the APHIS rule is the best course of action. Instead, I believe that we should focus on ensuring that the conditions set forth by APHIS are strictly enforced and that our agricultural industry is protected from any potential risks.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have worked to support the interests of American agriculture, including the beef industry. I believe that this bill, while well-intentioned, may not be the most effective way to address the concerns of our agricultural community.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of nullifying the APHIS rule and to work towards finding alternative solutions that balance the needs of our agricultural industry with the need to ensure the safety of our food supply.

I would like to ask Senator Tester, the sponsor of this bill, if he has considered alternative approaches to addressing the concerns of American ranchers and farmers, such as strengthening the enforcement of the APHIS conditions or providing additional support to our agricultural industry. I believe that we should work together to find a solution that benefits all parties involved.

Lisa Murkowski: As I consider this joint resolution, I must weigh the concerns of American ranchers and farmers, particularly those in my home state of Alaska, against the potential risks and benefits of importing fresh beef from Paraguay. While I understand the concerns about the potential introduction of foot-and-mouth disease, I also appreciate the thorough risk analysis conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

The conditions set forth by APHIS, including the absence of FMD in the exporting region and regular inspections of slaughter facilities, seem reasonable and necessary to ensure the safety of our food supply. As a senator who has consistently supported the interests of American agriculture, I believe that we should focus on ensuring that these conditions are strictly enforced, rather than nullifying the APHIS rule altogether.

I agree with Senator Moran that we should work together to find alternative solutions that balance the needs of our agricultural industry with the need to ensure the safety of our food supply. I would like to ask Senator Tester if he has considered strengthening the enforcement of the APHIS conditions or providing additional support to our agricultural industry, as Senator Moran suggested.

As a senator from Alaska, I must also consider the potential impact of this resolution on our state's agricultural industry, which is relatively small but vital to our local economy. I believe that we should prioritize the interests of American agriculture, while also ensuring that our food supply remains safe and secure.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against this joint resolution. I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule may not be the most effective way to address the concerns of our agricultural community, and I would like to work with my colleagues to find alternative solutions that benefit all parties involved.

I agree with Senators Moran and Murkowski that we should work together to find alternative solutions that balance the needs of our agricultural industry with the need to ensure the safety of our food supply.

While I understand that APHIS has conducted a risk analysis and established certain conditions for the importation of beef from Paraguay, I believe that these conditions are not sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with the introduction of foot-and-mouth disease.

I would like to address the suggestion made by several of my colleagues to strengthen the enforcement of the APHIS conditions or provide additional support to our agricultural industry. While I appreciate the willingness to find alternative solutions, I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule is the most effective way to address the concerns of our agricultural community.

Strengthening the enforcement of the APHIS conditions may not be enough to prevent the introduction of foot-and-mouth disease, and providing additional support to our agricultural industry may not be sufficient to offset the economic losses that could result from the importation of beef from Paraguay. Furthermore, I am concerned that relying on APHIS to enforce the conditions may not be enough, as the agency has a history of inadequate oversight and enforcement.

I would like to propose that instead of strengthening the enforcement of the APHIS conditions, we work together to find alternative solutions that address the concerns of American ranchers and farmers, while also ensuring that our food supply remains safe and secure. For example, we could consider implementing more stringent testing and inspection protocols for imported beef, or providing additional support to our agricultural industry to help them compete with foreign producers.

I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule is a necessary step to protect the interests of American agriculture and ensure the safety of our food supply. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of not taking action and to join me in voting in favor of this joint resolution.

In response to the comments made by my colleagues, I would like to say that I understand and respect their concerns, but I believe that we must take a strong stance to protect the interests of American agriculture. I am willing to work with my colleagues to find a solution that benefits all parties involved, but I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule is the most effective way to achieve this goal.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Let us work together to protect the interests of American agriculture and ensure the safety of our food supply.

John Thune: As I consider this joint resolution, I must weigh the concerns of American ranchers and farmers, particularly those in my home state of South Dakota, against the potential risks and benefits of importing fresh beef from Paraguay. While I understand the concerns about the potential introduction of foot-and-mouth disease, I also appreciate the thorough risk analysis conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

The conditions set forth by APHIS, including the absence of FMD in the exporting region and regular inspections of slaughter facilities, seem reasonable and necessary to ensure the safety of our food supply. As a senator who has consistently supported the interests of American agriculture, I believe that we should focus on ensuring that these conditions are strictly enforced, rather than nullifying the APHIS rule altogether.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Smith, Stabenow, and Sullivan, that we should work together to find alternative solutions that balance the needs of our agricultural industry with the need to ensure the safety of our food supply. I would like to ask Senator Tester if he has considered strengthening the enforcement of the APHIS conditions or providing additional support to our agricultural industry, as my colleagues have suggested.

As a senator from South Dakota, I must also consider the potential impact of this resolution on our state's agricultural industry, which is significant and vital to our local economy. I believe that we should prioritize the interests of American agriculture, while also ensuring that our food supply remains safe and secure.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against this joint resolution. I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule may not be the most effective way to address the concerns of our agricultural community, and I would like to work with my colleagues to find alternative solutions that benefit all parties involved.

I would like to say to Senator Tester that I appreciate his efforts to address the concerns of American ranchers and farmers, and I am willing to work with him to find a solution that benefits all parties involved.

In response to my colleagues, I would like to say that I understand and respect their concerns, but I believe that we must take a cautious approach when it comes to protecting the health and well-being of the American people. I agree with Senator Sanders that we must prioritize the safety and security of our food supply, but I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule may not be the most effective way to achieve this goal.

I would like to propose that we work together to find alternative solutions that address the concerns of American ranchers and farmers, while also ensuring that our food supply remains safe and secure. Perhaps we can consider strengthening the enforcement of the APHIS conditions or providing additional support to our agricultural industry.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of nullifying the APHIS rule and to work towards finding alternative solutions that balance the needs of our agricultural industry with the need to ensure the safety of our food supply.

Thomas Tillis: As I consider this joint resolution, I must weigh the concerns of American ranchers and farmers, particularly those in my home state of North Carolina, against the potential risks and benefits of importing fresh beef from Paraguay. While I understand the concerns about the potential introduction of foot-and-mouth disease, I also appreciate the thorough risk analysis conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

Tommy Tuberville: Folks, I'm gonna have to disagree with my colleagues on this one. As a senator from Alabama, I've got to think about the interests of our farmers and ranchers, and I believe that nullifying this APHIS rule is the right thing to do.

Now, I know some of my colleagues are saying that we should just strengthen the enforcement of the APHIS conditions, but I'm not convinced that's enough. We're talking about the potential introduction of foot-and-mouth disease here, and I don't think we can take any chances.

I understand that the APHIS has done a thorough risk analysis, but I've got to side with Senator Tester on this one. The conditions they've set forth just aren't enough to mitigate the risks associated with importing fresh beef from Paraguay.

As a Christian conservative, I've got to prioritize the safety and security of our food supply, and I believe that nullifying this rule is the best way to do that. I'm not willing to take any chances when it comes to the health and well-being of the American people.

So, I'll be voting in favor of this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of not taking action and to join me in protecting the interests of American agriculture.

To my colleagues who are voting against this resolution, I respect your concerns, but I've got to disagree. I think we're taking a big risk by allowing the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay, and I don't think it's worth it.

Let's work together to find alternative solutions that benefit all parties involved, but for now, I've got to prioritize the safety and security of our food supply. I'm voting yes on this joint resolution.

Thomas R. Carper: As I consider this joint resolution, I must weigh the concerns of American ranchers and farmers against the potential risks and benefits of importing fresh beef from Paraguay. While I understand the concerns about the potential introduction of foot-and-mouth disease, I also appreciate the thorough risk analysis conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

The conditions set forth by APHIS, including the absence of FMD in the exporting region and regular inspections of slaughter facilities, seem reasonable and necessary to ensure the safety of our food supply. As a senator who has consistently supported the interests of American agriculture, I believe that we should focus on ensuring that these conditions are strictly enforced, rather than nullifying the APHIS rule altogether.

Tom Cotton: I'm afraid I must strongly disagree with my colleagues who have expressed opposition to this joint resolution. As a senator from Arkansas, a state with a significant agricultural industry, I understand the concerns of our ranchers and farmers about the potential risks of importing fresh beef from Paraguay.

While I appreciate the thorough risk analysis conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), I believe that the conditions set forth to ensure the safety of our food supply are not sufficient to mitigate the risks of foot-and-mouth disease. The fact that FMD has been present in Paraguay in the past and that the country's veterinary infrastructure may not be equipped to detect and respond to outbreaks effectively raises serious concerns about the safety of importing fresh beef from Paraguay.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the potential economic impact on our domestic beef industry. Allowing imports of fresh beef from Paraguay could lead to a flood of cheap, foreign beef into our markets, which could harm the livelihoods of American ranchers and farmers.

I understand that some of my colleagues have suggested that we should focus on strengthening the enforcement of the APHIS conditions or providing additional support to our agricultural industry. However, I believe that these measures are not sufficient to address the concerns of our agricultural community.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution. I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule is the most effective way to protect the health and well-being of the American people and to support the interests of American agriculture.

Deb Fischer: As a senator from Nebraska, a state with a significant agricultural industry, I understand the concerns of our ranchers and farmers about the potential introduction of foot-and-mouth disease. After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of this joint resolution.

I agree with my colleagues, such as Senators Cruz, Daines, and Ernst, that the conditions set forth by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) may not be sufficient to mitigate the risks of foot-and-mouth disease. The fact that FMD has been present in Paraguay in the past and that the country's veterinary infrastructure may not be equipped to detect and respond to outbreaks effectively raises serious concerns about the safety of importing fresh beef from Paraguay.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the potential economic impact on our domestic beef industry. Allowing imports of fresh beef from Paraguay could lead to a flood of cheap, foreign beef into our markets, which could harm the livelihoods of American ranchers and farmers.

While I appreciate the comments from Senators Duckworth, Durbin, and Fetterman, who have expressed opposition to the resolution, I believe that we must take a cautious approach when it comes to protecting the health and well-being of the American people. I agree that we must prioritize the safety and security of our food supply, and I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule is the most effective way to achieve this goal.

I would like to propose that we work together to find alternative solutions that address the concerns of American ranchers and farmers, while also ensuring that our food supply remains safe and secure.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of allowing imports of fresh beef from Paraguay and to join me in supporting this joint resolution. We must prioritize the safety and security of our food supply and protect the interests of American agriculture.

John Kennedy: Folks, I'm gonna vote in favor of this joint resolution. Now, I know some of my colleagues are concerned about the potential risks of foot-and-mouth disease, and I understand that. But I believe the conditions set forth by APHIS may not be sufficient to mitigate those risks. As a senator from Louisiana, I've seen firsthand the importance of protecting our agricultural industry, and I think nullifying this rule is a necessary step to ensure the safety of our food supply.

Now, I know some folks might say, "But Senator Kennedy, what about the potential impact on our trade relationships with other countries?" And I'll tell you, I'm not insensitive to that concern.

Ultimately, I believe that we must take a thoughtful and nuanced approach to this issue, one that balances the needs of our agricultural industry with the need to ensure the safety and security of our food supply.

Rand Paul: The joint resolution before us today seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regarding the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay.

Bernard Sanders: The issue at hand is whether to nullify the APHIS rule allowing for the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay into the United States. As a senator from Vermont, I have to consider the potential risks and benefits of this decision.

First and foremost, I am committed to protecting the health and well-being of the American people. The risk of foot-and-mouth disease is a serious concern, and I understand why many of my colleagues are hesitant to allow the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay.

However, I also believe that we must take a science-based approach to this issue. The APHIS rule provides a framework for importing fresh beef from Paraguay, with certain conditions in place to mitigate the risk of foot-and-mouth disease. I think it's worth considering whether these conditions are sufficient, rather than simply nullifying the rule altogether.

I've listened to the comments of my colleagues, including Senators Risch, Romney, and Rubio, who have expressed concerns about the potential risks of importing fresh beef from Paraguay. I understand their concerns, but I also think that we should be careful not to overreact.

As a democratic socialist, I believe that we should prioritize the interests of the American people, including our farmers and ranchers. But I also believe that we should be open to international trade and cooperation, as long as it's done in a way that protects the health and well-being of our citizens.

In this case, I think that the APHIS rule provides a reasonable framework for importing fresh beef from Paraguay. I'm not convinced that nullifying the rule is the best solution, and I'm worried that it could have unintended consequences for our trade relationships and the American economy.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of nullifying the APHIS rule, and to work with me to find a solution that prioritizes the safety and security of our food supply, while also promoting international cooperation and trade.

Tommy Tuberville: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I'm reminded of my roots as a football coach. You see, in football, you've got to make tough decisions, and sometimes that means playing it safe. When it comes to the safety and security of our food supply, I believe we've got to take a cautious approach. That's why I'm voting in favor of this joint resolution to nullify the APHIS rule allowing the importation of fresh beef from Paraguay.

I've listened to my colleagues, including Senators Sullivan, Tester, Thune, and Tillis, and I agree with them that we can't take any chances when it comes to the risk of foot-and-mouth disease. Our ranchers and farmers are the backbone of this country, and we've got to protect their livelihoods. I'm not convinced that the APHIS rule provides sufficient safeguards to mitigate the risks of foot-and-mouth disease, and I think it's essential that we take a science-based approach to protecting our food supply.

Now, I know some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the potential impact on our trade relationships and the American economy.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against this joint resolution.

I appreciate the comments of my colleagues, including Senators Sullivan, Tester, Thune, Tillis, and Tuberville, who have highlighted the importance of protecting our food supply. However, I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule would be an overreaction and could have unintended consequences on our trade relationships and the American economy.

I'd like to respond specifically to Senator Jon Tester, who has expressed concerns about the potential risks of foot-and-mouth disease. I agree with him that we must prioritize the safety and security of our food supply, but I believe that the APHIS rule strikes a reasonable balance between protecting our food supply and allowing for the importation of high-quality beef from Paraguay.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in taking a thoughtful and balanced approach to importing beef from countries with different animal health and food safety systems. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits all parties involved and prioritizes the health and well-being of the American people.

However, I believe that the potential risks to our food supply and the health and well-being of the American people outweigh any potential benefits of importing beef from Paraguay.

I appreciate the comments of my colleagues, including Senators Tester, Thune, Tillis, and Tuberville, who have highlighted the importance of protecting our food supply. I agree with them that we must prioritize the safety and security of our food supply, and I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule is a reasonable and necessary step to ensure the safety and security of our food supply.

In response to Senator Van Hollen's comments, I would like to say that I understand his concerns about the potential consequences of nullifying the APHIS rule, but I believe that the risks associated with importing fresh beef from Paraguay outweigh any potential benefits. I'm willing to work with anyone who is willing to find a solution that prioritizes the safety and security of our food supply, but I think that nullifying the APHIS rule is a necessary step to protect the health and well-being of the American people.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in taking a cautious approach to importing beef from countries with different animal health and food safety systems. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits all parties involved and prioritizes the safety and security of our food supply. I'm committed to supporting our agricultural industry, while also ensuring that we take a science-based approach to protecting the health and well-being of the American people.

Mark R. Warner: As I consider this joint resolution, I must weigh the concerns of American ranchers and farmers against the potential risks and benefits of importing fresh beef from Paraguay. As a senator from Virginia, I have a deep understanding of the importance of protecting our food supply and the health and well-being of the American people.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against this joint resolution. While I understand the concerns about the potential risks of foot-and-mouth disease, I believe that the APHIS rule provides sufficient safeguards to mitigate those risks. The rule requires that FMD has not been diagnosed in the exporting region within the previous 12 months, that the meat originated from premises where FMD has not been present during the lifetime of any bovines slaughtered for U.S. meat export, and that APHIS may periodically conduct on-site evaluations and subsequent inspections of the slaughter facilities, records, and operations.

I appreciate the comments of my colleagues, including Senators Thune, Tillis, Tuberville, and Vance, who have highlighted the importance of protecting our food supply. However, I believe that nullifying the APHIS rule would be an overreaction and could have unintended consequences on our trade relationships and the American economy.

I'd like to respond specifically to Senator Jon Tester, who has expressed concerns about the potential risks of foot-and-mouth disease. I agree with him that we must prioritize the safety and security of our food supply, but I believe that the APHIS rule strikes a reasonable balance between protecting our food supply and allowing for the importation of high-quality beef from Paraguay.

To my colleagues who have expressed support for this joint resolution, I urge you to consider the potential consequences of nullifying the APHIS rule.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in taking a thoughtful and balanced approach to importing beef from countries with different animal health and food safety systems. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits all parties involved and prioritizes the health and well-being of the American people.

Regarding the comments made by my colleagues, I would like to say that I understand and respect their concerns, but I believe that we must take a nuanced approach to this issue. I agree with Senator Van Hollen that nullifying the APHIS rule could have unintended consequences, and I believe that we should work together to find a solution that addresses the concerns of all parties involved.

In particular, I would like to respond to Senator Thune's comment that the APHIS rule may not provide sufficient safeguards to mitigate the risks of foot-and-mouth disease. While I understand his concerns, I believe that the rule provides a reasonable framework for ensuring the safety of our food supply, and I would like to work with him to identify any potential areas for improvement.

Similarly, I would like to respond to Senator Tillis's comment that we must prioritize the safety and security of our food supply. I agree with him that this is a critical issue, and I believe that we must take a cautious approach to importing beef from countries with different animal health and food safety systems. However, I also believe that we must consider the potential impact on our trade relationships and the American economy, and I would like to work with him to find a solution that balances these competing interests.

Overall, I believe that we must take a thoughtful and balanced approach to this issue, and I am committed to working with my colleagues to find a solution that prioritizes the health and well-being of the American people.
