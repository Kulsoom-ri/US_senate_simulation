Tammy Baldwin: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of air pollution on our communities, our environment, and our economy.

The EPA's rule is a crucial step forward in reducing air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which are significant contributors to ozone and particulate matter pollution. By modifying emission standards, we can improve air quality, protect public health, and mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

I am deeply concerned that this joint resolution would undermine the progress we have made in reducing air pollution and would put the health and well-being of our citizens at risk. The science is clear: air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles poses a significant threat to our environment and public health. We should be working to strengthen our emissions standards, not weaken them.

Furthermore, I am disappointed that this resolution has been introduced without adequate consideration of the potential consequences. The EPA's rule was developed through a thorough and transparent process, with input from stakeholders and experts. It is a carefully crafted regulation that balances the need to reduce air pollution with the need to support our economy.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have had the opportunity to review this resolution and the underlying rule. I can tell you that the EPA's rule is a reasonable and necessary step to protect our environment and public health. I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and instead work with me to build on the progress we have made in reducing air pollution.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided effort to undermine our environmental protections. We owe it to our constituents, our children, and our planet to take bold action to reduce air pollution and protect our environment. This resolution is a step in the wrong direction, and I will not support it.

John Barrasso: I rise today to express my strong support for this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards. As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of overregulation on our economy, our communities, and our energy industry.

The EPA's rule is a prime example of the kind of burdensome regulation that can stifle innovation, kill jobs, and drive up costs for American consumers. By modifying emission standards, the EPA is essentially imposing a de facto ban on certain types of heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which will have a disproportionate impact on rural states like Wyoming.

I understand that my colleague, Senator Baldwin, is concerned about the environmental impact of air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles. But I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals without resorting to draconian regulations that will harm our economy and our energy industry.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this rule was developed without adequate consideration of the potential consequences for our economy and our energy industry. The EPA's rule was developed through a process that was rushed and opaque, without sufficient input from stakeholders and experts.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have had the opportunity to review this resolution and the underlying rule. I can tell you that the EPA's rule is a misguided and unnecessary step that will do more harm than good. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and reject the EPA's rule.

I will be voting yes on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided effort to undermine our economy and our energy industry. We owe it to our constituents, our children, and our country to take a balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our energy industry.

In response to Senator Baldwin's comments, I would like to say that I understand her concerns about air pollution, but I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals without resorting to overregulation. I would be happy to work with her to find a more balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our energy industry. However, I must respectfully disagree with her opposition to this joint resolution, and I hope that we can have a more nuanced and balanced discussion about the impact of this rule on our economy and our energy industry.

Thomas R. Carper: The debate on this joint resolution has been quite lively, and I appreciate the thoughtful comments from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I have had the opportunity to review this resolution and the underlying rule. I must say that I strongly disagree with the resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards.

The EPA's rule is a crucial step forward in reducing air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which are significant contributors to ozone and particulate matter pollution. By modifying emission standards, we can improve air quality, protect public health, and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. I believe that this rule is a reasonable and necessary step to protect our environment and public health.

I understand that some of my colleagues are concerned about the potential impact of this rule on our economy and energy industry. However, I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals without resorting to draconian regulations that will harm our economy and energy industry. In fact, I think that investing in clean energy and reducing air pollution can actually create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

I also want to address the argument that this rule was developed without adequate consideration of the potential consequences for our economy and energy industry. I disagree with that assessment. The EPA's rule was developed through a thorough and transparent process, with input from stakeholders and experts. It is a carefully crafted regulation that balances the need to reduce air pollution with the need to support our economy.

As someone who has always championed the importance of protecting our environment and public health, I believe that this rule is a crucial step forward in ensuring that our communities are protected from the harmful effects of air pollution. I will not support any effort to undermine our environmental protections and put the health and well-being of our constituents at risk.

Therefore, I will be voting no on this joint resolution. I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided effort to undermine our environmental protections and instead work with me to build on the progress we have made in reducing air pollution and protecting our environment.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on our economy and energy industry, I would like to say that I understand and share their concerns. However, I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals without overregulating our economy and energy industry. I am committed to working with them to find a more balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our energy industry.

Let us work together to protect our environment and public health, while also supporting our economy and energy industry. We owe it to our constituents, our children, and our planet to take bold action to reduce air pollution and protect our environment. This resolution is a step in the wrong direction, and I will not support it.

Joni Ernst: As I consider this joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of the importance of balancing our environmental goals with the needs of our economy and energy industry. As a senator from Iowa, I have to consider the impact of this rule on our state's economy, particularly the agriculture industry, which is a significant sector in our state.

While I understand the importance of reducing air pollution and protecting our environment, I also believe that we need to be mindful of the potential consequences of overregulation. The EPA's rule could have a disproportionate impact on rural states like Iowa, where our economy is heavily reliant on industries that would be affected by this rule.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Cassidy, Cornyn, Cotton, Cramer, Crapo, Cruz, and Daines, that we need to find a balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our energy industry. This joint resolution is a step in the right direction, as it would nullify the EPA's rule and allow us to reconsider our approach to environmental regulation.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on our environment and public health, I would like to say that I understand and share their concerns. However, I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals without overregulating our economy and energy industry. I am committed to working with them to find a more balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our energy industry.

As a senator from Iowa, I have a responsibility to protect the interests of our state and our constituents. I believe that this joint resolution is a necessary step to ensure that our economy and energy industry are not unfairly burdened by overregulation. Therefore, I will be voting yes on this joint resolution.

I would like to respond to Senator Tammy Duckworth, who expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on our environment and public health. I understand her concerns, but I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals without resorting to draconian regulations that will harm our economy and energy industry. I am committed to working with her to find a more balanced approach to environmental regulation.

I also want to address Senator Richard Durbin's comments, and I must respectfully disagree with his assertion that this joint resolution is a misguided attempt to undermine the EPA's rule. I believe that we need to take a step back and reassess our approach to environmental regulation, and this joint resolution provides us with an opportunity to do so.

In conclusion, I believe that this joint resolution is a necessary step to ensure that our economy and energy industry are not unfairly burdened by overregulation. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and reject the EPA's rule. Let us work together to find a more balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our energy industry. I will be voting yes on this joint resolution.

John Fetterman: I'm voting no on this joint resolution. As a senator from Pennsylvania, I believe it's our responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our citizens, and this EPA rule is a crucial step towards reducing air pollution and protecting our environment. The science is clear: air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles is a major contributor to poor air quality, respiratory problems, and other serious health issues. We must take bold action to address this problem, not roll back the progress we've made.

I understand that some of my colleagues are concerned about the potential impact of this rule on our economy and energy industry, but I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals without harming our economy. In fact, investing in clean energy and reducing pollution can create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

I'm disappointed, but not surprised, to see my Republican colleagues putting the interests of big polluters and corporations ahead of the needs of our communities. We must stand up for the health and well-being of our citizens, not cave to the special interests of polluters and corporations. It's time for us to take a stand and protect our environment, our public health, and our future.

I'd like to respond to Senator Cruz, who said that this rule goes too far and would have a disproportionate impact on states like Texas. I understand that different states have different needs and concerns, but I believe that we must prioritize the health and well-being of all Americans, regardless of where they live. We can't let the interests of one state or industry dictate our environmental policies.

I'd also like to respond to Senator Ernst, who said that we need to find a balanced approach to environmental regulation. I agree that we need to find a balance, but I believe that this EPA rule is a necessary step towards reducing air pollution and protecting our environment. We can't just talk about balance and then vote to undermine the very regulations that are designed to protect our health and well-being.

In conclusion, I believe that this joint resolution is a misguided attempt to undermine the EPA's rule and harm our environment and public health. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this joint resolution and standing up for the health and well-being of our citizens. We must take bold action to address the pressing environmental challenges of our time, not roll back the progress we've made.

Senators Duckworth, Durbin, and Fetterman have all expressed concerns about the potential impact of this joint resolution on our environment and public health. I understand and respect their concerns, but I must respectfully disagree.

The EPA's rule, while well-intentioned, is an example of overregulation that will have a disproportionate impact on rural states like Nebraska, where our economy is heavily reliant on industries that will be affected by this rule. We need to find a balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our energy industry.

I'd like to respond to Senator Duckworth, who said that we're putting the interests of big polluters and corporations ahead of the needs of our communities. That's not accurate. We're simply trying to find a more balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that doesn't unfairly burden our economy and energy industry.

I'd also like to respond to Senator Durbin, who said that this joint resolution is a misguided attempt to undermine the EPA's rule. I disagree. We're not trying to undermine the EPA's rule; we're trying to reassess our approach to environmental regulation and find a more balanced approach.

To Senator Fetterman, I'd say that while I understand his concerns about the impact of this rule on Pennsylvania, I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals without harming our economy. In fact, I think we can find ways to reduce pollution and promote clean energy that will actually create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

In conclusion, I believe that this joint resolution is a necessary step to ensure that our economy and energy industry are not unfairly burdened by overregulation. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and reject the EPA's rule. Let us work together to find a more balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our energy industry.

We must take bold action to address this problem, not roll back the progress we've made.

I am particularly concerned about the impact of air pollution on the health and well-being of our citizens, particularly children, seniors, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. The EPA's rule is a necessary step towards reducing the emissions that contribute to poor air quality and protecting the health of our communities.

I would like to respond to Senator Ernst, who said that we need to find a balanced approach to environmental regulation.

The science is clear: air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles is a major contributor to poor air quality, respiratory problems, and other serious health issues. We must take bold action to address this problem, not roll back the progress we've made.

As a senator from Nevada, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of air pollution on our communities, particularly in urban areas where access to healthcare is limited. We must prioritize the health and well-being of our citizens, and that's exactly what the EPA's rule does.

However, I believe that this joint resolution is a misguided attempt to undermine the EPA's rule and harm our environment and public health.

We must take bold action to address the pressing environmental challenges of our time, not roll back the progress we've made.

The science is clear: air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles is a major contributor to poor air quality, respiratory problems, and other serious health issues. We must take bold action to address this problem, not roll back the progress we've made.

I would like to respond to Senator Warren, who mentioned that investing in clean energy and reducing pollution is a moral imperative.

Tammy Baldwin: As I consider this joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of the critical importance of protecting our environment and public health. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of air pollution on our communities, particularly in urban areas like Milwaukee.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues who argue that this rule is an example of overregulation.

I agree that we should be working towards a balanced approach, but I believe that nullifying the EPA's rule is not the right solution. Instead, we should be working to find solutions that balance our economic and environmental needs, rather than simply undermining the EPA's authority to regulate pollution and protect public health.

I also disagree with Senators Budd and Capito, who argue that the EPA's rule could have a disproportionate impact on states like North Carolina and West Virginia. While I understand their concerns, I believe that the benefits of reducing air pollution far outweigh any potential economic costs. In fact, a study by the American Lung Association found that the EPA's rule could prevent up to 2,900 premature deaths and 41,000 cases of respiratory problems annually.

As a senator who has been a strong supporter of environmental protection and public health, I believe that we have a moral obligation to protect our environment and ensure that our citizens have access to clean air and water. I will not support any effort to undermine the EPA's authority to regulate pollution and protect public health.

In conclusion, I will be voting no on this joint resolution, as I believe that it is not a necessary step towards finding a more balanced approach to environmental regulation. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this joint resolution and to work towards a more sustainable future for our nation, one that balances our economic and environmental needs.

We owe it to our children, our seniors, and our communities of color, who are disproportionately affected by air pollution, to take bold action to reduce pollution and protect our environment. I will continue to work towards a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for all Americans. I will be voting no on this resolution.

I strongly disagree with the sentiments expressed by my colleagues who support this joint resolution. The EPA's rule is a crucial step towards reducing air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which is essential for the well-being of our citizens, particularly those in communities that are disproportionately affected by pollution. I believe that investing in clean energy and reducing pollution is not only a moral imperative, but it also makes economic sense. It can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and improve public health.

I'd like to respond to Senator Cantwell, who emphasized the importance of protecting our environment and public health. I agree that we have a moral obligation to protect our environment, but I also believe that we need to be pragmatic and responsible in our approach to environmental regulation. We need to find solutions that balance our economic and environmental needs, rather than simply undermining the EPA's authority to regulate pollution and protect public health.

In Louisiana, we have a strong tradition of responsible economic development, and I am committed to continuing that tradition.

Their commitment to protecting our environment and public health is truly commendable, and I am proud to stand with them in opposition to this resolution.

I would also like to respond to Senator Collins, who expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of the EPA's rule. While I understand her concerns, I believe that the benefits of reducing air pollution far outweigh any potential economic costs. In fact, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the economic benefits of reducing air pollution can be substantial, including increased productivity, improved public health, and reduced healthcare costs.

In contrast, I am disappointed by the comments of Senator Cassidy, who seems to prioritize economic interests over environmental and public health concerns. As a senator, I believe that we have a moral obligation to protect our environment and ensure that our citizens have access to clean air and water. We must not sacrifice our values and our commitment to environmental protection on the altar of economic expediency.

In the end, I believe that this joint resolution is a step in the wrong direction. It would undermine the EPA's authority to regulate pollution and protect public health, and it would put the interests of polluters and special interests above those of our citizens. I will do everything in my power to oppose this resolution and to protect the health and well-being of the American people.

Tammy Duckworth: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards. As a senator from Illinois, I am deeply concerned about the impact of air pollution on the health and well-being of my constituents, particularly in urban areas like Chicago.

The EPA's rule is a critical step forward in reducing air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which are a major source of ozone and particulate matter. These pollutants have serious health consequences, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death. By nullifying this rule, we would be putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.

I understand that some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the economic implications of this rule, but I believe that we can find a balanced approach that protects both our environment and our economy. In fact, investing in clean energy and reducing pollution can create jobs and stimulate local economies. We should be working to promote sustainable economic growth, not undermining our environmental protections.

I would like to respond to my colleagues who have argued that this joint resolution is necessary to find a more balanced approach to environmental regulation. I agree that we need to be mindful of the economic implications of our actions, but I do not believe that nullifying this rule is the right solution. Instead, we should be working to improve the rule and make it more effective, not throwing it out altogether.

I would also like to address the comments made by Senators Cotton, Cramer, Crapo, Cruz, and Daines, who have all argued that we need to find a balanced approach to environmental regulation. I agree that balance is important, but I do not believe that nullifying this rule is the right way to achieve it. We should be working to find solutions that protect both our environment and our economy, not pitting one against the other.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and instead work towards finding a balanced approach to environmental regulation that protects both our environment and our economy. We owe it to our constituents to prioritize their health and safety, and to promote sustainable economic growth that benefits everyone. I will be voting no on this joint resolution.

By nullifying this rule, we would be putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.

I would like to commend my colleague, Senator Duckworth, for her thoughtful and well-reasoned argument in opposition to this joint resolution. Her commitment to protecting our environment and public health is truly commendable, and I am proud to stand with her in opposition to this resolution.

In conclusion, I believe that this joint resolution is a step in the wrong direction. It would undermine the critical protections provided by the EPA's rule and put the health and safety of our citizens at risk.

Tim Kaine: As I consider this joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of the importance of protecting our environment and public health. As a senator from Virginia, I have seen firsthand the impact of air pollution on our communities, particularly in urban areas.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, as I believe that it is a step in the wrong direction. We should be working to improve the rule and make it more effective, not throwing it out altogether. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and working towards a more sustainable future for our nation, one that prioritizes the health and safety of our citizens and the protection of our environment.

In particular, I would like to address the comments made by Senator McConnell. While I understand his concerns about the economic implications of this rule, I believe that we need to take a more proactive approach to addressing climate change and air pollution.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues, such as Senators Menendez and Merkley, about the importance of protecting our environment and public health, I believe that we need to be mindful of the economic implications of our actions. The EPA's rule, while well-intentioned, may have unintended consequences on our economy, particularly in the trucking and transportation industries, which are critical to our state's economy.

As a fiscal conservative, I believe that we need to consider the potential costs of this rule on our economy, particularly on small businesses and farmers, and weigh them against the potential benefits. I also believe that we should be working to improve the rule and make it more effective, rather than throwing it out altogether.

However, after careful consideration, I have decided to vote yes on this joint resolution. I believe that it is a necessary step towards finding a more balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that takes into account both the economic and environmental implications of our actions.

In response to my colleagues who have spoken out against this joint resolution, I would say that I understand their concerns about the importance of protecting our environment and public health, but I believe that we cannot afford to undermine the competitiveness of our economy, particularly during a time of economic uncertainty. We need to be pragmatic and responsible in our approach to environmental regulation, and consider the potential costs and benefits of our actions.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues, Senators Fischer, Moran, and Mullin, who are advocating for the nullification of this critical rule. The EPA's rule is a necessary step forward in reducing air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which are a major source of ozone and particulate matter. These pollutants have serious health consequences, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death.

I'd like to commend my colleagues, Senators Murphy, Murray, and Hassan, who have spoken out against this joint resolution and emphasized the importance of protecting our environment and public health. I stand with them in opposition to this resolution.

As a member of the Commerce Committee, I have seen the impact of air pollution on our communities and our economy. I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing this issue, one that takes into account the complex interplay between economic, environmental, and public health factors.

I understand that my colleagues, Senators Paul and Murkowski, have expressed concerns about the economic implications of this rule. However, I believe that we cannot afford to prioritize economic interests over the health and safety of our citizens. The cost of inaction far outweighs the costs of implementing this rule.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, as I believe that it is a step in the wrong direction. We should be working to improve the rule and make it more effective, not throwing it out altogether. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and working towards a more sustainable future for our nation, one that prioritizes the health and safety of our citizens and the protection of our environment.

In response to Senator Paul's comments, I would say that while I understand his concerns about government overreach, I believe that this rule is a necessary step in protecting public health and the environment. I am willing to work with my colleagues to find a more balanced solution, one that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection.

To my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the economic implications of this rule, I would say that we must consider the long-term benefits of reducing air pollution and protecting public health. The cost of inaction far outweighs the costs of implementing this rule. We must take a proactive approach to addressing climate change and air pollution, and this rule is a crucial step in that direction.

I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this joint resolution and working towards a more sustainable future for our nation. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to protect our environment and ensure that our actions do not harm the health and safety of our citizens.

Mike Rounds: As I consider this joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of the importance of balancing our economic and environmental needs. As a senator from South Dakota, I have seen firsthand the impact of regulations on our agricultural and transportation industries.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues, Senators Reed, Rosen, and others, about the importance of protecting our environment and public health, I also believe that we must be mindful of the potential economic implications of this rule. As a former governor, I have seen the impact of overregulation on our economy and our small businesses.

I agree with Senators Ricketts and Risch that we must be careful not to stifle economic growth and innovation with overly burdensome regulations. However, I also believe that we have a responsibility to protect the health and safety of our citizens, particularly when it comes to issues like air pollution.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of this joint resolution. I believe that the EPA's rule goes too far and that it will have a disproportionate impact on our rural communities and small businesses. I think that we can achieve our environmental goals without imposing unnecessary burdens on our economy.

I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term consequences of our actions. Let's work together to find a more balanced solution that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection. We can do better than this rule, and I'm willing to work with you to find a more effective and efficient way to reduce air pollution and protect public health.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the health and safety implications of this rule, I would say that I understand and share their concerns. However, I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing these issues, one that takes into account the complex interplay between economic, environmental, and public health factors.

I am willing to work with my colleagues to find a more balanced solution, one that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection. But I believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step in reining in the power of the EPA and promoting a more balanced approach to environmental regulation.

These pollutants have serious health consequences, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues who are advocating for the nullification of this critical rule. The costs of implementing this rule are far outweighed by the benefits of reducing air pollution and protecting public health. In fact, the EPA estimates that this rule will prevent up to 2,900 premature deaths, 1,700 hospitalizations, and 18,000 cases of respiratory problems each year.

I'd like to commend my colleagues, Senators Romney and Rosen, who have spoken out against this joint resolution and emphasized the importance of protecting our environment and public health. I stand with them in opposition to this resolution.

To my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the economic implications of this rule, I would say that we cannot afford to prioritize economic interests over the health and safety of our citizens. The cost of inaction far outweighs the costs of implementing this rule. In fact, a study by the American Lung Association found that the economic benefits of reducing air pollution from heavy-duty vehicles would be approximately $150 billion per year.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, as I believe that it is a step in the wrong direction. We should be working to improve the rule and make it more effective, not throwing it out altogether. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and working towards a more sustainable future for our nation, one that prioritizes the health and safety of our citizens and the protection of our environment.

In response to Senator Risch's comments, I would say that I understand his concerns about the economic implications of this rule, but I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing these issues, one that takes into account the complex interplay between economic, environmental, and public health factors. We cannot afford to prioritize short-term economic gains over the long-term health and well-being of our citizens.

To Senator Rubio, I would say that I respect his concerns about the importance of balancing our economic and environmental needs, but I believe that this rule is a necessary step forward in reducing air pollution and protecting public health.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution.

Dan Sullivan: The joint resolution before us today seeks to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards. As a senator from Alaska, I have to consider the unique challenges and opportunities that our state faces when it comes to environmental protection and economic development.

While I understand the importance of reducing air pollution and protecting public health, I also believe that we must be mindful of the potential economic implications of this rule on our rural communities and small businesses. Alaska is a resource-rich state, and our economy is heavily reliant on industries such as mining, logging, and fishing. We must ensure that any regulations we impose do not unnecessarily burden these industries and stifle economic growth.

I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleagues, Senators Shaheen, Sinema, Smith, and Stabenow, about the importance of protecting our environment and public health. However, I also believe that we can achieve these goals without imposing overly burdensome regulations on our economy.

I will be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the EPA's rule. I believe that this rule is an example of federal overreach and that we should be working to find more balanced solutions that promote both economic growth and environmental protection.

I would like to respond to Senator Shaheen's comments, who said that we cannot afford to prioritize economic interests over the health and safety of our citizens. I agree that we must prioritize the health and safety of our citizens, but I also believe that we can do so in a way that does not unnecessarily harm our economy.

I would also like to respond to Senator Sinema's comments, who proposed working together to find a more effective and efficient way to reduce air pollution and protect public health. I agree that we should be working together to find solutions, and I am willing to work with my colleagues to find a more balanced approach that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection.

In conclusion, I believe that the joint resolution to nullify the EPA's rule is a necessary step to ensure that we are not imposing overly burdensome regulations on our economy. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and working towards a more balanced solution that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection.

John Thune: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of my commitment to finding a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. As a senator from South Dakota, I have to consider the unique challenges and opportunities that our state faces when it comes to environmental protection and economic development.

While I understand the importance of reducing air pollution and protecting public health, I also believe that we must be mindful of the potential economic implications of this rule on our rural communities and small businesses. South Dakota is a state with a strong agricultural industry, and our economy is heavily reliant on industries such as farming and ranching. We must ensure that any regulations we impose do not unnecessarily burden these industries and stifle economic growth.

I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleagues, Senators Sinema, Smith, and Stabenow, about the importance of protecting our environment and public health. However, I also believe that we can achieve these goals without imposing overly burdensome regulations on our economy.

Thomas Tillis: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of my commitment to finding a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. As a senator from North Carolina, I have to consider the unique challenges and opportunities that our state faces when it comes to environmental protection and economic development.

While I understand the importance of reducing air pollution and protecting public health, I also believe that we must be mindful of the potential economic implications of this rule on our rural communities and small businesses. North Carolina is a state with a strong manufacturing industry, and our economy is heavily reliant on industries such as textiles and automotive manufacturing. We must ensure that any regulations we impose do not unnecessarily burden these industries and stifle economic growth.

I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleagues, Senators Sinema, Smith, and Stabenow, about the importance of protecting our environment and public health. However, I also believe that we can achieve these goals without imposing overly burdensome regulations on our economy.

Tommy Tuberville: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I have to say that I'm strongly in favor of nullifying this rule. As a senator from Alabama, I've seen firsthand the impact that overly burdensome regulations can have on our economy and our small businesses.

While I understand the importance of reducing air pollution and protecting public health, I believe that this rule goes too far. It's an example of federal overreach, and it's going to hurt our economy and our rural communities. We need to find a more balanced approach that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection.

I've heard my colleagues, Senators Smith and Stabenow, talk about the importance of protecting our environment and public health, and I agree with them. But I also believe that we can do so in a way that doesn't unnecessarily harm our economy. We need to be mindful of the potential economic implications of this rule and make sure that we're not imposing overly burdensome regulations on our industries.

I'm willing to work with my colleagues to find a more balanced approach, but I believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and working towards a more balanced solution that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection.

As a Christian conservative, I believe that we have a responsibility to be good stewards of the earth, but I also believe that we have a responsibility to be good stewards of our economy and our communities. We need to find a balance between these two goals, and I believe that nullifying this rule is a step in the right direction.

So, I'll be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the EPA's rule. I believe it's the right thing to do for our economy, our communities, and our environment.

Chris Van Hollen: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of my long-standing commitment to protecting our environment and public health. The science is clear: climate change is real, and it's having a devastating impact on our planet. The EPA's rule is a necessary step forward in reducing air pollution from heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which are a major source of ozone and particulate matter. These pollutants have serious health consequences, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even premature death.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues who are advocating for the nullification of this critical rule. The costs of implementing this rule are far outweighed by the benefits of reducing air pollution and protecting public health. In fact, the EPA estimates that this rule will prevent up to 2,900 premature deaths, 1,700 hospitalizations, and 18,000 cases of respiratory problems each year.

I'd like to commend my colleagues, Senators Romney and Rosen, who have spoken out against this joint resolution and emphasized the importance of protecting our environment and public health. I stand with them in opposition to this resolution.

To my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the economic implications of this rule, I would say that we cannot afford to prioritize economic interests over the health and safety of our citizens. The cost of inaction far outweighs the costs of implementing this rule. In fact, a study by the American Lung Association found that the economic benefits of reducing air pollution from heavy-duty vehicles would be approximately $150 billion per year.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, as I believe that it is a step in the wrong direction. We should be working to improve the rule and make it more effective, not throwing it out altogether. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and working towards a more sustainable future for our nation, one that prioritizes the health and safety of our citizens and the protection of our environment.

In response to my colleagues who have spoken in favor of the joint resolution, I would say that I understand their concerns about the potential economic implications of this rule, but I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing these issues, one that takes into account the complex interplay between economic, environmental, and public health factors. We cannot afford to prioritize short-term economic gains over the long-term health and well-being of our citizens.

I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it. Let's work together to find a more balanced solution that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection, and prioritizes the health and safety of our citizens and the protection of our environment.

J. D. Vance: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of my commitment to finding a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. As a senator from Ohio, I have to consider the unique challenges and opportunities that our state faces when it comes to environmental protection and economic development.

Vance, I understand their concerns about the potential economic implications of this rule, but I believe that we must prioritize the health and safety of our citizens and the protection of our environment.

As a pastor and a senator, I believe that we have a moral obligation to protect the most vulnerable among us, including our children, our seniors, and our communities of color, who are disproportionately affected by air pollution. We must take a stand against pollution and for the health and well-being of our citizens. I will not be swayed by arguments that prioritize short-term economic gains over the long-term health and well-being of our citizens. We must do better, and we must do it now.

Roger F. Wicker: I rise today to express my strong support for the joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards. As a senator from Mississippi, I have seen the devastating impact of overregulation on our economy and our citizens. This rule, which was published on January 24, 2023, would impose significant costs on our nation's trucking industry, leading to higher prices for consumers and lost jobs for hardworking Americans.

I understand that my colleagues, Senators Warnock, Warren, Welch, and Whitehouse, have expressed concerns about the potential health impacts of air pollution from heavy-duty vehicles. However, I believe that we must take a balanced approach to addressing these issues, one that takes into account the complex interplay between economic, environmental, and public health factors. We cannot afford to prioritize environmental regulations over the economic well-being of our citizens.

In fact, I believe that this rule would have a disproportionate impact on rural areas like Mississippi, where trucking is a vital part of our economy. Our state is already struggling with high poverty rates and limited economic opportunities. We cannot afford to impose additional burdens on our businesses and our citizens.

I would like to commend Senator Fischer, the sponsor of this joint resolution, for her leadership on this issue. I also appreciate the support of my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. I urge my fellow senators to join me in supporting this joint resolution and working towards a more balanced approach to environmental regulation, one that prioritizes the economic well-being of our citizens and the protection of our environment.

Todd Young: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards, I am reminded of the delicate balance between economic growth and environmental protection. While I understand the concerns of my colleagues, Senators Welch, Whitehouse, and Wyden, about the potential health impacts of air pollution from heavy-duty vehicles, I also recognize the need to consider the economic implications of this rule.

As a senator from Indiana, I have seen firsthand the importance of the trucking industry to our state's economy. The rule, as written, would impose significant costs on our nation's trucking industry, leading to higher prices for consumers and lost jobs for hardworking Americans. I believe that we must take a balanced approach to addressing these issues, one that takes into account the complex interplay between economic, environmental, and public health factors.

I appreciate the concerns of Senators Warnock, Warren, and others about the potential health impacts of air pollution, but I believe that we cannot afford to prioritize short-term environmental gains over the long-term economic well-being of our citizens. I agree with Senator Wicker that we must consider the disproportionate impact of this rule on rural areas like Mississippi and Indiana, where trucking is a vital part of our economy.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the EPA's rule. I believe that this resolution is a necessary step towards finding a more balanced solution that promotes both economic growth and environmental protection. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and working towards a more sustainable future for our nation, one that prioritizes the health and safety of our citizens and the protection of our environment, while also considering the economic well-being of our citizens.

I would like to commend Senator Fischer for her leadership on this issue and appreciate the support of my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. I look forward to continuing this conversation and finding a solution that works for all Americans.
