Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 39, seeks to nullify the final rule submitted by the Department of Commerce regarding the suspension of duties on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules, commonly known as solar panels, that are completed in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam using parts and components manufactured in China.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I have to consider the impact of this resolution on our domestic solar panel industry, as well as the broader implications for our trade policies. While I understand the concerns about the potential impact of Chinese components on our domestic industry, I also believe that we need to approach this issue in a thoughtful and nuanced manner.

The rule in question allows for the suspension of duties on these solar panels, which could help to increase the availability of affordable solar energy options for American consumers and businesses. This, in turn, could help to drive the growth of our clean energy sector, create jobs, and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

However, I also recognize that we need to ensure that our trade policies are fair and equitable, and that we are not inadvertently subsidizing Chinese companies at the expense of American workers. That's why I would have preferred to see a more comprehensive approach to addressing these issues, one that takes into account the complex global supply chains and the need to promote American manufacturing and competitiveness.

Unfortunately, this joint resolution does not provide a thoughtful or comprehensive solution to these challenges. Instead, it simply seeks to nullify the Commerce Department's rule without offering any alternative approaches or solutions.

For these reasons, I will be voting against H.J. Res. 39. I believe that we need to take a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges facing our domestic solar panel industry, one that promotes American manufacturing and competitiveness while also supporting the growth of our clean energy sector.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and instead work towards a more thoughtful and bipartisan approach to addressing these complex issues.

John Barrasso: The joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 39, is a straightforward matter of protecting American workers and industries from unfair trade practices. As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of cheap, Chinese-made components on our domestic energy sector. The rule submitted by the Department of Commerce, which allows for the suspension of duties on certain solar panels completed in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam using Chinese parts, is a clear example of the kind of unfair trade practices that we should be working to prevent.

My colleague, Senator Baldwin, expresses concerns about the potential impact on the domestic solar panel industry, but I believe that her concerns are misplaced. The reality is that this rule would only serve to further undercut American manufacturers and workers, who are already struggling to compete with the artificially low prices of Chinese-made components. By nullifying this rule, we can help to level the playing field and ensure that American companies have a fair shot at competing in the global market.

I also take issue with Senator Baldwin's suggestion that we need a more comprehensive approach to addressing these issues. While I agree that our trade policies should be thoughtful and nuanced, I believe that this joint resolution is a necessary step in the right direction. We cannot continue to allow Chinese companies to take advantage of our open markets and generous trade policies, while American workers and industries suffer as a result.

I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 39, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure. We owe it to American workers and industries to take a strong stand against unfair trade practices, and to ensure that our trade policies are fair, equitable, and beneficial to our nation as a whole.

As a senator from Florida, I have seen firsthand the impact of promoting clean energy on our economy and our environment.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 39. I believe that nullifying the Commerce Department's rule is necessary to prevent unfair trade practices and protect American solar panel manufacturers. The rule in question allows for the suspension of duties on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules that are completed in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam using parts and components manufactured in China. I am concerned that this rule could lead to unfair competition for American solar panel manufacturers and potentially harm our domestic industry.

I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues, Senators Murray, Ossoff, Padilla, Peters, and Reed, about the potential impact on the domestic solar panel industry and the growth of our clean energy sector. However, I believe that we must take a stand against unfair trade practices and protect American workers and industries.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the domestic solar panel industry, I would say that I understand their concerns, but I believe that we must consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We cannot allow foreign companies to take advantage of our trade laws and harm American workers and industries.

I agree with Senator Ricketts that we must work towards a comprehensive solution that promotes American manufacturing and competitiveness, while also supporting the growth of our clean energy sector. Nullifying the Commerce Department's rule is a necessary step towards achieving this goal.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 39, and I urge my colleagues to join me in working towards a solution that benefits American workers, industries, and our nation as a whole, while also promoting the growth of our clean energy sector.

In response to Senator Reed, I would say that I understand his concerns about the potential impact on the domestic solar panel industry, but I believe that we must prioritize the protection of American workers and industries. I also appreciate Senator Ricketts' and Senator Romney's thoughtful considerations, but I must respectfully disagree with their conclusions. I believe that nullifying the Commerce Department's rule is a necessary step to prevent unfair trade practices and protect American solar panel manufacturers.

I will be voting "Yes" on H.J. Res. 39.

As a senator from Georgia, I have seen firsthand the impact of promoting clean energy on our economy and our environment.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against H.J. Res. 39. I believe that the Commerce Department's rule, which allows for the suspension of duties on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam, using parts and components manufactured in China, is a necessary step towards achieving our clean energy goals and promoting the growth of our domestic solar panel industry.

I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues, Senators Moran and Mullin, about the potential impact of the Commerce Department's rule on American solar panel manufacturers and workers. However, I believe that we must take a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to promoting American manufacturing and competitiveness, and that this resolution is a step backwards.

Nullifying the Commerce Department's rule would undermine our efforts to promote clean energy and would harm American workers and industries in the long run. We must prioritize the growth of our clean energy sector and the creation of good-paying jobs in this industry.

I'd like to commend Senators Menendez, Merkley, Markey, Murphy, and Murray for their thoughtful remarks on this issue. I agree with them that we must prioritize the protection of American workers and industries, and promote the growth of our clean energy sector, rather than taking a step backwards with this resolution.

As a senator who has worked to promote the growth of our economy and support American workers, I believe that this resolution would be a step in the wrong direction. We must prioritize the protection of American workers and industries, and promote the growth of our clean energy sector, rather than taking a step backwards with this resolution.

Therefore, I will be voting "No" on H.J. Res. 39, and I urge my colleagues to join me in working towards a solution that benefits American workers, industries, and our nation as a whole, while also promoting the growth of our clean energy sector. We must prioritize the protection of American workers and industries, and promote the growth of our clean energy sector, rather than taking a step backwards with this resolution.

Sheldon Whitehouse: I rise today to express my strong opposition to H.J. Res. 39, a joint resolution that seeks to nullify the Commerce Department's rule allowing for the suspension of duties on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam, using parts and components manufactured in China. As a senator from Rhode Island, I have seen firsthand the impact of climate change on our coastal communities and the importance of promoting clean energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.

This resolution is a step backwards in our efforts to promote clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Commerce Department's rule is a necessary step towards achieving our clean energy goals and promoting the growth of our domestic solar panel industry. Nullifying this rule would undermine our efforts to promote clean energy and would harm American workers and industries in the long run.

I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues about the potential impact of the Commerce Department's rule on American solar panel manufacturers and workers. However, I believe that we must take a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to promoting American manufacturing and competitiveness, and that this resolution is not the right step forward.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Warner, Warnock, and Elizabeth Warren, that we must prioritize the growth of our clean energy sector and the creation of good-paying jobs in this industry. We must also consider the long-term benefits of promoting clean energy and the growth of our domestic solar panel industry.

I urge my colleagues to join me in voting "No" on H.J. Res. 39 and working towards a solution that benefits American workers, industries, and our nation as a whole, while also promoting the growth of our clean energy sector. We must prioritize the protection of American workers and industries, and promote the growth of our clean energy sector, rather than taking a step backwards with this resolution.

As someone who has dedicated their career to fighting climate change, I am deeply concerned about the impact of this resolution on our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a clean energy economy. I will be voting "No" on H.J. Res. 39, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided resolution.

Roger F. Wicker: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 39, I am reminded of the importance of promoting fair and equitable trade practices, while also supporting the growth of our domestic industries, particularly in the clean energy sector. As a senator from Mississippi, I have seen firsthand the impact of unfair trade practices on our economy and our workers.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 39. I believe that the Commerce Department's rule, which allows for the suspension of duties on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam, using parts and components manufactured in China, is a threat to American solar panel manufacturers and workers.

Nullifying the Commerce Department's rule would protect American workers and industries in the long run. We must prioritize the growth of our domestic manufacturing sector and the creation of good-paying jobs in this industry. I agree with my colleagues, Senators Thune, Tuberville, and Vance, that we must take a strong stance against unfair trade practices and promote American manufacturing and competitiveness.

I'd like to commend Senators Sullivan, Thune, and others who have spoken out in support of this resolution. I agree with them that we must prioritize the protection of American workers and industries, and promote the growth of our domestic manufacturing sector, rather than taking a step backwards with the Commerce Department's rule.

Ron Wyden: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 39, I am reminded of the importance of promoting fair and equitable trade practices, while also supporting the growth of our domestic industries, particularly in the clean energy sector. As a senator from Oregon, I have seen firsthand the impact of unfair trade practices on our economy and our workers.

Todd Young: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, H.J.
