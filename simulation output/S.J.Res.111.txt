John Barrasso: The proposed joint resolution before us today, introduced by Senator Sanders, seeks to disapprove a proposed foreign military sale to the Government of Israel. As a strong supporter of our ally Israel, I must express my opposition to this resolution.

The sale in question involves the transfer of defense articles and services, including 120mm tank cartridges and related munitions, to Israel. This sale is crucial for Israel's national security, particularly given the ongoing threats it faces from neighboring countries and terrorist organizations.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I believe it is essential to carefully consider the implications of this sale and ensure that it aligns with our national interests and foreign policy goals. However, I strongly disagree with the notion that we should disapprove this sale outright.

Israel is a vital partner in the Middle East, and it is essential that we support its ability to defend itself against the many threats it faces. The sale of these defense articles and services will help to enhance Israel's military capabilities and contribute to the stability of the region.

Furthermore, I am concerned that disapproving this sale would send the wrong signal to our allies and adversaries alike. It would undermine our commitment to Israel's security and potentially embolden those who seek to do it harm.

Therefore, I will be voting against the motion to discharge the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. I believe that this committee should be allowed to thoroughly review and consider the proposed sale, rather than having it rushed to the floor for a vote.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and in supporting our ally Israel. We must prioritize the security and stability of the region, and this sale is an important step in achieving that goal.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the motion to discharge the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. I believe that this committee should be allowed to do its job and provide a thorough review of the proposed sale, rather than having it short-circuited by a vote on the floor.

I understand that Senator Barrasso has expressed his opposition to this resolution, and I respect his perspective. However, I also believe that it is essential for us to have a nuanced and thoughtful discussion about our foreign policy decisions, rather than simply relying on partisan rhetoric or ideological positions.

In conclusion, I will be voting against the motion to discharge the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a thoughtful and deliberative approach to this important issue. We must prioritize the security and stability of the region, and this sale is an important step in achieving that goal.

While I understand the concerns about the potential harm to civilians and the escalation of violence in the region, I also believe that we must support our ally, Israel, in its efforts to defend itself against threats in the region.

Therefore, I will be voting "No" on the motion to discharge the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. I believe that our committee system is in place to provide a thorough and thoughtful review of such matters, and I have faith in the ability of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations to do just that.

Let us allow the committee to do its work and provide us with a comprehensive review of this proposed sale. I am confident that, together, we can find a solution that prioritizes human rights, security, and stability in the region, while also upholding our commitment to our ally, Israel.

I believe that this issue is too important to be rushed, and we must ensure that we are making an informed decision that takes into account all of the potential consequences.

In conclusion, I urge my fellow senators to oppose the motion to discharge the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and allow the committee to do its work. We must prioritize the protection of human rights and the security and stability of the region, and we must be willing to take the time necessary to ensure that we are making the right decision. I will be voting "No" on this motion, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting our ally, Israel, while also prioritizing the well-being of the entire region.
