Tammy Baldwin: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt. As a long-time advocate for affordable education and economic opportunity, I believe that this rule is a crucial step towards providing relief to millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on our economy, and many students and families are still feeling the effects. By suspending federal student loan payments and discharging debt, we can help to alleviate some of the financial burden that is holding them back. This is not only a matter of economic justice, but also a matter of basic fairness. Why should we be forcing students and families to take on debt that they cannot afford, when we have the power to provide them with relief?

I also want to note that this joint resolution is not just about student loans - it's about the values that we hold as a society. Do we believe in investing in our young people and giving them the opportunity to succeed, or do we believe in prioritizing the interests of wealthy corporations and special interests? I believe that we should be investing in our people, and that's why I will be voting against this joint resolution.

To my colleagues who are supporting this resolution, I urge you to consider the impact that it will have on real people's lives. This is not just a abstract policy debate - it's about the families who are struggling to make ends meet, the students who are trying to pursue their dreams, and the communities that are being held back by debt and financial insecurity. Let's stand with them, and let's vote against this resolution.

As for the argument that this rule is somehow unconstitutional or an overreach of executive authority, I disagree. The Department of Education has the authority to take actions to protect the interests of students and borrowers, and this rule is a reasonable exercise of that authority. Furthermore, Congress has the power to review and approve or disapprove of this rule, and that's exactly what we're doing today.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution because I believe that it's the wrong thing to do for our students, our families, and our economy. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution, and to instead work with us to find solutions that will provide real relief and opportunity to those who need it most.

John Barrasso: As I stand here today, I strongly support the joint resolution to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt. This rule, in my opinion, is a prime example of executive overreach and a clear abuse of power. The Department of Education has no authority to unilaterally cancel hundreds of billions of dollars in student loan debt, and it's our duty as lawmakers to hold them accountable.

I understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our economy, and many students and families are struggling to make ends meet. However, suspending federal student loan payments and discharging debt is not a long-term solution to this problem. In fact, it's a band-aid approach that will only lead to more problems down the line.

We need to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars, and this rule is a clear example of fiscal irresponsibility. The cost of canceling student loan debt will be borne by the American people, and it's our duty to ensure that we're not placing an undue burden on future generations.

I also disagree with my colleague, Senator Baldwin, who argues that this rule is a matter of economic justice and basic fairness. While I understand the sentiment, I believe that we need to take a more nuanced approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt. We need to work towards finding solutions that will provide real relief to students and families, without placing an undue burden on taxpayers.

As for the argument that this rule is somehow constitutional, I strongly disagree. The Department of Education has overstepped its authority, and it's our duty as lawmakers to hold them accountable. We need to ensure that we're upholding the Constitution and the rule of law, rather than allowing executive agencies to run amok.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution because I believe that it's the right thing to do for our students, our families, and our economy. We need to take a responsible and nuanced approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt, rather than relying on band-aid solutions that will only lead to more problems down the line. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and working towards finding real solutions that will provide relief and opportunity to those who need it most.

Marsha Blackburn: The debate on this joint resolution has been quite passionate, and I appreciate the sentiments expressed by my colleagues, Senators Baldwin and Barrasso. As a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention, I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Barrasso's assessment of the situation.

The rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt is, in my opinion, a clear example of executive overreach and a blatant disregard for the constitutional separation of powers. The Department of Education has no authority to unilaterally cancel hundreds of billions of dollars in student loan debt, and it's our duty as lawmakers to hold them accountable.

As a senator from Tennessee, I've seen firsthand the impact of excessive government spending and debt on our economy. We need to take a responsible and sustainable approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt, rather than relying on band-aid solutions that will only lead to more problems down the line.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, as I believe it's the right thing to do for our students, our families, and our economy. We need to take a stand against executive overreach and ensure that we're upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and working towards finding real solutions that will provide relief and opportunity to those who need it most.

Richard Blumenthal: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Barrasso and Blackburn, have expressed concerns about the constitutionality of this rule and the potential impact on taxpayers. However, I believe that these concerns are misplaced. The Department of Education has the authority to take actions to protect the interests of students and borrowers, and this rule is a reasonable exercise of that authority.

Furthermore, I believe that the benefits of this rule far outweigh the costs. By providing relief to students and families, we can help to stimulate economic growth, reduce inequality, and promote social mobility. This is not a partisan issue, but a matter of basic human decency and compassion.

I urge my colleagues to consider the impact that this joint resolution will have on real people's lives.

Let's stand with them, and let's vote against this resolution.

As for the arguments made by my colleagues, I respectfully disagree. Senator Barrasso's claim that this rule is a prime example of executive overreach is unfounded. The Department of Education has the authority to take actions to protect the interests of students and borrowers, and this rule is a reasonable exercise of that authority.

Senator Blackburn's argument that this rule is a clear example of fiscal irresponsibility is also misplaced. The cost of canceling student loan debt will be borne by the American people, but it is a necessary investment in our future. We need to take a responsible and sustainable approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt, and this rule is a step in the right direction.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution because I believe that it's the wrong thing to do for our students, our families, and our economy. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution, and to instead work with us to find solutions that will provide real relief and opportunity to those who need it most.

Angus S. King Jr.: The debate on this joint resolution has been quite lively, and I appreciate the thoughtful comments from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As an independent senator from Maine, I've always tried to approach issues with a pragmatic and nuanced perspective.

While I understand the concerns about executive overreach and the constitutional implications of the Department of Education's rule, I also believe that we need to consider the very real burden of student loan debt on individuals and families in our country. As someone who has worked on issues related to education and economic development, I know that student loan debt can be a significant obstacle to economic mobility and opportunity.

I've heard some of my colleagues argue that canceling student loan debt would be a costly and unsustainable solution, and I agree that we need to be mindful of the fiscal implications of any policy decision. However, I also believe that we need to think about the long-term benefits of investing in our people and our economy.

As I consider this joint resolution, I'm reminded of my own experiences as a governor and a senator, working to find solutions that balance competing interests and priorities. I've always tried to be a problem-solver, rather than an ideologue, and I think that's what's needed in this debate.

So, after careful consideration, I've decided to vote against this joint resolution. I believe that we should be working to find solutions that provide real relief and opportunity to those who need it most, rather than simply nullifying the Department of Education's rule. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and to instead work with us to find a more thoughtful and sustainable approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt.

It's a burden that can hold people back from achieving their full potential, from buying homes, from starting businesses, and from contributing to their communities.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues who argue that this rule is a clear example of executive overreach and a blatant disregard for the constitutional separation of powers. I believe that the Department of Education has the authority to take actions to protect the interests of students and borrowers, and this rule is a reasonable exercise of that authority.

I appreciate the comments made by Senators Hickenlooper, Hirono, and Kaine, who eloquently spoke about the importance of supporting our students and families. I couldn't agree more. This is a matter of economic justice and basic fairness. We should be investing in our people, not placing an undue burden on them.

In response to Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, I would say that I understand their concerns about fiscal responsibility, but I believe that the cost of canceling student loan debt is a necessary investment in our future.

I will be voting against this joint resolution because I believe it's the wrong thing to do for our students, our families, and our economy.

I will vote NO on this joint resolution.

Jon Ossoff: As I consider this joint resolution to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt, I am reminded of my commitment to supporting our students and families who are struggling to make ends meet. As a senator from Georgia, I have seen firsthand the impact that student loan debt can have on individuals and families in my state. It's a burden that can hold people back from achieving their full potential, from buying homes, from starting businesses, and from contributing to their communities.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues who argue that this rule is a clear example of executive overreach and a blatant disregard for the constitutional separation of powers. I believe that the Department of Education has the authority to take actions to protect the interests of students and borrowers, and this rule is a reasonable exercise of that authority.

As someone who has experienced the struggles of working-class families, I understand the importance of making higher education accessible and affordable. My parents, who immigrated to this country from Mexico, worked tirelessly to provide for our family, and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to attend college and pursue my dreams. However, I know that many students and families are not as fortunate, and they are struggling to make ends meet due to the burden of student loan debt.

I also appreciate the comments made by Senator Bernard Sanders, who argued that canceling student loan debt is a matter of economic justice and basic fairness. However, I believe that we need to ensure that any actions taken are fiscally responsible and sustainable in the long term.

Ultimately, as a senator, I have a responsibility to consider the impact of our actions on the economy and the well-being of our citizens. I believe that voting in favor of this joint resolution is the right thing to do, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in taking a responsible and sustainable approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt. 

I must say, I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the comments made by Senator Schumer, who seems more interested in scoring political points than in finding a responsible solution to the issue of student loan debt. I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan politics and work together to find a solution that is in the best interest of our students, our families, and our economy. 

I also want to respond to Senator Sanders, who said that this joint resolution is a step in the wrong direction. I disagree, and I believe that this resolution is a necessary step towards taking a more responsible and sustainable approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt. I understand that Senator Sanders and I may have different opinions on this issue, but I hope that we can have a respectful and constructive debate about the best way to address this issue.

In conclusion, I will vote YES on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in taking a responsible and sustainable approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt.

I appreciate the comments made by Senators Brian Schatz, Jacky Rosen, and Gary C. Peters, who eloquently spoke about the importance of supporting our students and families. I couldn't agree more.

John Kennedy: Folks, I'm gonna vote yes on this joint resolution. I think it's a mighty fine idea to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt. Now, I know some of my colleagues are gonna say, "But John, what about all those poor students who are struggling with debt?" And I'll tell you, I feel for 'em. I really do. But the fact is, we can't just keep kicking the can down the road and expecting someone else to pay for it.

I mean, think about it. If we just cancel all this debt, who's gonna foot the bill? The taxpayers, that's who. And I'm not sure that's fair to them. We need to take a more comprehensive approach to addressing this issue, one that considers the long-term implications and the impact on our economy.

Now, I know some of my colleagues, like Senators Kaine and Kelly, are gonna say we need to take bold action to address this crisis. And I agree, we do need to take action. But we need to make sure it's responsible action, not just some knee-jerk reaction to a problem that's been building for years.

I'm a fiscal conservative, folks, and I believe in being responsible with the people's money. We can't just keep spending and spending without thinking about the consequences. We need to find a solution that's fair, equitable, and responsible. And that's why I'm voting yes on this joint resolution.

As for my colleagues' comments, I appreciate their passion, but I think they're missing the point. This isn't just about helping students; it's about being responsible with the people's money. We need to think about the long-term implications of our actions, not just the short-term gains.

So, I'll be voting yes on this joint resolution, and I hope my colleagues will join me in taking a responsible approach to addressing this issue. We owe it to the American people to get this right.

As a senator from Kansas, I have seen the impact of student loan debt on individuals and families in my state, and I understand the concerns about the impact of this debt on our economy.

However, I strongly believe that we need to consider the long-term implications of canceling debt and the potential consequences for the economy and taxpayers. The rule issued by the Department of Education may provide temporary relief, but it's not a sustainable solution. We need to think about the consequences of our actions and how they will affect the economy and the taxpayers in the long run.

I agree with Senators Lankford, Lee, Lummis, and Manchin that we need to take a comprehensive approach to addressing this issue, one that considers the long-term implications and the impact on our economy. Canceling debt without a plan to pay for it is not a responsible solution, and it's not fair to the taxpayers who will ultimately foot the bill.

In response to my colleagues' comments, I would like to say that I appreciate their passion and concern for this issue. However, I strongly disagree with the notion that we can simply cancel debt without considering the long-term implications.

I will be voting yes on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education.

In particular, I would like to respond to Senator Markey's comments.

I also appreciate Senator Merkley's comments, and I agree that we need to take a comprehensive approach to addressing this issue.

Christopher Murphy: As I consider this joint resolution to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt, I am reminded of the countless conversations I've had with constituents in Connecticut who are struggling to make ends meet due to the crushing weight of student loan debt. As a senator, I have seen firsthand the impact of this debt on individuals and families, and I understand the concerns about the impact of this debt on our economy.

However, I strongly disagree with the notion that nullifying this rule is the right solution. The rule issued by the Department of Education may provide temporary relief, but it's a necessary step towards addressing the student loan debt crisis that has been decades in the making. We need to think about the consequences of our actions and how they will affect the economy and the taxpayers in the long run, but we also need to consider the human impact of student loan debt and the need for relief.

I agree with Senator Merkley that we need to take a comprehensive approach to addressing this issue, one that considers the long-term implications and the impact on our economy. We need to increase funding for public education, provide more generous grants and scholarships, and implement income-driven repayment plans that make it easier for borrowers to manage their debt. We also need to consider alternative solutions that provide relief to those who need it most, such as debt forgiveness programs or income-driven repayment plans.

Rand Paul: The issue of student loan debt is a complex one, and I appreciate the passion and concern that my colleagues have brought to this debate. However, I must respectfully disagree with their opposition to this joint resolution.

As a senator who has consistently advocated for fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention, I believe that nullifying the rule issued by the Department of Education is a necessary step towards addressing the student loan debt crisis. This rule, which suspends federal student loan payments and discharges debt, is a prime example of the kind of government overreach that I have always opposed.

While I understand the concerns about the human impact of student loan debt, I believe that we must also consider the long-term implications of this rule on our economy and our taxpayers. Simply putting the burden of debt forgiveness on the backs of taxpayers is not a sustainable or responsible solution.

Instead, I believe that we need to take a more comprehensive approach to addressing the issue of student loan debt. This includes increasing funding for public education, providing more generous grants and scholarships, and implementing income-driven repayment plans that make it easier for borrowers to manage their debt.

But we must also be mindful of the fact that the federal government cannot simply wave a magic wand and make debt disappear. We must be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensure that any solution we propose is fiscally sustainable and does not put an undue burden on future generations.

I will be voting yes on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education.

I would also like to address Senator Ossoff's comment that we need to take a comprehensive approach to addressing this issue.

As a senator from Idaho, I have seen firsthand the impact of student loan debt on individuals and families in my state.

As a senator, I have seen firsthand the impact of this debt on individuals and families, and I understand the concerns about the impact of this debt on our economy.

I strongly disagree with the notion that nullifying this rule is the right solution. The rule issued by the Department of Education may provide temporary relief, but it's a necessary step towards addressing the student loan debt crisis that has been decades in the making.

I would also like to address Senator Romney's comments. I agree with him that we need to take a comprehensive approach to addressing this issue, and I appreciate his emphasis on the importance of fiscal responsibility. However, I would like to add that we must also consider the role of the private sector in addressing the student loan debt crisis. We need to encourage private lenders to offer more affordable and flexible repayment options, and we need to promote financial literacy and education to help borrowers make informed decisions about their debt.

In conclusion, I will be voting yes on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this effort to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education.

Bernard Sanders: The debate on this joint resolution is a perfect example of the stark contrast between the priorities of my Republican colleagues and those of the American people. My colleagues, Senators Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, are more concerned with the long-term implications of our actions on the economy and taxpayers than with the human impact of student loan debt on individuals and families.

Let me be clear: the student loan debt crisis is a crisis of affordability, a crisis of accessibility, and a crisis of fairness. It is a crisis that affects millions of Americans, from recent graduates to seniors, who are struggling to make ends meet due to the crushing weight of student loan debt.

The rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt is a necessary step towards addressing this crisis. It provides temporary relief to those who need it most, and it is a crucial step towards creating a more sustainable and equitable system of higher education.

But my Republican colleagues would have you believe that this rule is fiscally irresponsible, that it puts an undue burden on taxpayers, and that it is a form of government overreach. I say, what about the burden of student loan debt on individuals and families? What about the impact of this debt on our economy, on our communities, and on our society as a whole?

We need to think about the consequences of our actions, not just in terms of the budget, but in terms of the human impact. We need to consider the fact that millions of Americans are struggling to pay off their student loans, that they are delaying major life decisions, such as buying a home or starting a family, because of the weight of this debt.

I will not be swayed by the arguments of my Republican colleagues. I will not be convinced that nullifying this rule is the right solution. Instead, I will stand with the American people, with the students, with the families, and with the communities who are affected by this crisis.

I will vote no on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this misguided effort to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education. We owe it to our students, our families, and our economy to get this right, to find a solution that provides relief to those who need it most, while also considering the long-term implications and the impact on our economy.

To my colleagues, I say: let us work together to find a comprehensive solution to the student loan debt crisis. Let us increase funding for public education, provide more generous grants and scholarships, and implement income-driven repayment plans that make it easier for borrowers to manage their debt. Let us think about the human impact of this crisis, and let us act with compassion, with empathy, and with a commitment to creating a more just and equitable society for all.

In conclusion, I will be voting no on this joint resolution. I believe that we should be working to find a solution that provides relief to those who need it most while also considering the long-term implications and the impact on our economy. I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided effort to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education. Let's work together to find a solution that provides relief to those who need it most while also considering the long-term implications and the impact on our economy. We owe it to our students, our families, and our economy to get this right and to find a solution that provides relief to those who need it most.

Roger F. Wicker: As I consider this joint resolution to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt, I am reminded of the importance of fiscal responsibility and the need to ensure that our actions do not put an undue burden on taxpayers. 

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Thune and Tuberville, that we must prioritize the long-term implications of our actions and the impact on our economy. Nullifying this rule may provide temporary relief to some borrowers, but it would also add to our nation's debt and potentially harm our economy in the long run.

As a senator from Mississippi, I have seen firsthand the struggles that many of my constituents face in paying off their student loans. However, I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis, one that includes increasing funding for public education, providing more generous grants and scholarships, and implementing income-driven repayment plans that make it easier for borrowers to manage their debt.

I will be voting yes on this joint resolution. I believe that we must take a stand for fiscal responsibility and ensure that our actions do not harm our economy in the long run. While I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues, including Senators Van Hollen and Warnock, about the human impact of student loan debt, I strongly believe that we must also consider the fiscal responsibility of this rule and ensure that any solution we propose is sustainable and does not put an undue burden on future generations.

In response to Senator Warnock's comments, I would like to say that I respect his opinion, but I must respectfully disagree. I believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step to prevent further harm to our economy and to ensure that we are taking a responsible approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis.

Let's work together to find a solution that provides relief to those who need it most while also considering the long-term implications and the impact on our economy. But for now, I believe that nullifying this rule is the right thing to do.

Ron Wyden: As I stand here today, I am reminded of the countless Oregonians who have shared with me their struggles with student loan debt. The weight of this debt is crushing, and it's a burden that we must address. The rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt is a necessary step towards providing relief to those who need it most.

I strongly disagree with the approach taken by this joint resolution, which would nullify this rule and leave millions of Americans without the relief they so desperately need. I understand that some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the fiscal responsibility of this rule, and I respect their opinions. However, I firmly believe that we must consider the human impact of student loan debt and the need for relief.

This is not just a matter of fiscal responsibility; it's a matter of basic human dignity. We're talking about people who are struggling to pay for their education, who are struggling to make ends meet, and who are being crushed by the weight of debt. I will not stand idly by while we deny them the relief they need.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Van Hollen, Tillis, Warnock, and Warren, that we must find a balanced solution that addresses both the fiscal responsibility and the human impact of student loan debt. However, I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards providing relief to millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet.

I would like to respond to Senator Thune's comments, who stated that nullifying this rule may provide temporary relief to some borrowers, but it would also add to our nation's debt and potentially harm our economy in the long run. I understand his concerns, but I believe that we must consider the immediate needs of our constituents and take bold action to address this crisis. We're not talking about a handout; we're talking about a necessary investment in our nation's future.

In conclusion, I will be voting no on this joint resolution. I believe that we should be working to find a solution that provides relief to those who need it most while also considering the long-term implications and the impact on our economy. I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided effort to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education. Let's work together to find a solution that provides relief to those who need it most while also considering the long-term implications and the impact on our economy. We owe it to our students, our families, and our economy to get this right and to find a solution that provides relief to those who need it most.

Todd Young: As I consider this joint resolution to nullify the rule issued by the Department of Education to suspend federal student loan payments and discharge debt, I am reminded of the importance of fiscal responsibility and the need to ensure that our actions do not put an undue burden on taxpayers.

While I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues, including Senators Warren, Welch, Whitehouse, and Wyden, about the human impact of student loan debt, I strongly believe that we must also consider the fiscal responsibility of this rule and ensure that any solution we propose is sustainable and does not put an undue burden on future generations.

As a senator from Indiana, I have seen firsthand the struggles that many of my constituents face in paying off their student loans. However, I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis, one that includes increasing funding for public education, providing more generous grants and scholarships, and implementing income-driven repayment plans that make it easier for borrowers to manage their debt.

I believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step to prevent further harm to our economy and to ensure that we are taking a responsible approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis.

Therefore, I will be voting yes on this joint resolution. I believe that we must take a stand for fiscal responsibility and ensure that our actions do not harm our economy in the long run.
