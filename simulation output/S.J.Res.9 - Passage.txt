Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, introduced by Senator Marshall, aims to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always been committed to protecting our environment and preserving the natural beauty of our country for future generations.

After careful consideration, I must express my opposition to this joint resolution. The listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species is a crucial step in conserving this iconic species and its habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to list the Northern Distinct Population Segment as threatened and the Southern Distinct Population Segment as endangered is based on scientific evidence and a thorough review of the species' status.

I understand that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the potential economic impacts of this listing, but I believe that we must prioritize the long-term conservation of our natural resources over short-term economic interests. The Endangered Species Act is a vital tool for protecting species like the lesser prairie-chicken, and we must ensure that it is enforced in a way that is fair, effective, and based on the best available science.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this joint resolution could set a precedent for undermining the Endangered Species Act and the scientific process that underlies it. As a nation, we have a responsibility to protect our natural heritage and preserve the beauty and diversity of our environment for future generations.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work towards finding solutions that balance the needs of our economy and our environment. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and the future of our planet to act responsibly and protect our natural resources for generations to come.

John Barrasso: The joint resolution before us today is a crucial step in protecting the interests of Wyoming and the American people. As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our economy and our way of life. The listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species is a perfect example of how the federal government can overstep its bounds and impose unnecessary burdens on our farmers, ranchers, and energy producers.

I strongly disagree with my colleague, Senator Baldwin, who suggests that we should prioritize the conservation of this species over the economic interests of our citizens. While I understand the importance of protecting our environment, I believe that we can do so in a way that balances the needs of our economy and our natural resources.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to list the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species is not based on sound science, but rather on a flawed and outdated process. This listing will have a devastating impact on our agriculture and energy industries, and will ultimately harm the very people we are trying to protect.

I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in nullifying this misguided rule. We must stand up for the rights of our citizens and protect our economy from the overreach of the federal government. The Endangered Species Act is an important tool for protecting our environment, but it must be used in a responsible and balanced way.

I would like to remind my colleagues that this joint resolution is not about undermining the Endangered Species Act, but rather about ensuring that it is used in a way that is fair, effective, and based on sound science. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and the future of our country to act responsibly and protect our natural resources in a way that balances the needs of our economy and our environment.

In Colorado, we have seen the importance of conservation efforts in protecting our natural resources and promoting sustainable economic development. I believe that we can balance the needs of our economy and our environment, and that conservation efforts can actually create jobs and stimulate local economies.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution.

Tammy Duckworth: I strongly oppose this joint resolution. As a senator from Illinois, I understand the importance of protecting our environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations. The listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species is a crucial step in ensuring the long-term survival of this species.

By protecting the lesser prairie-chicken and its habitat, we can also support eco-tourism and outdoor recreation, which can bring in revenue and create jobs.

I'm gonna vote against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to protect our natural resources and preserve the beauty and wonder of our planet.

To my colleagues who are supporting this resolution, I say: let's work together to find solutions that promote both economic growth and environmental protection. We can do better than this. We can find ways to balance the needs of our economy and our environment, and I'm willing to work with anyone who's willing to put in the effort to get it done.

But this joint resolution? It's a step in the wrong direction. It's a threat to our environment, and it's a threat to the very principles of conservation that we should be upholding. I'm gonna vote no, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this measure.

John Kennedy: The lesser prairie-chicken.  Now, I'm all for conservation, but we gotta be smart about it.  We can't just list a species as threatened or endangered without considering the economic implications.  I mean, think about it, folks.  The lesser prairie-chicken's habitat overlaps with a lot of our agricultural areas.  If we list it as threatened or endangered, that's gonna lead to a whole lot of regulatory burdens and economic costs for our farmers and ranchers.

Now, I know some of my colleagues are gonna say, "But John, we gotta protect the environment."  And I agree, we do.  But we can't just do it without thinking about the consequences.  We gotta find a balance between protecting the environment and protecting our economy.

I've been listening to my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, and I agree with them.  We need to take a more balanced approach to conservation.  We can't just let the bureaucrats at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service make decisions without considering the impact on our economy.

So, I'm gonna vote yes on this joint resolution, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure.

Angus S. King Jr.: The lesser prairie-chicken.  As an independent senator from Maine, I've always tried to find a balance between protecting our environment and promoting economic growth.

Roger F. Wicker: I rise today to express my strong support for this joint resolution, which nullifies the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species. As a senator from Mississippi, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact that overregulation can have on our economy and our way of life.

The listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species would have far-reaching consequences for our farmers, ranchers, and landowners. It would impose significant burdens on them, including costly compliance measures and restrictions on their ability to use their land. This would not only harm their livelihoods but also stifle economic growth and development in our state.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential impact on the environment, but I believe that we can protect the lesser prairie-chicken without resorting to such drastic measures. We should be working to find solutions that balance our economic interests with our environmental responsibilities, rather than pitting them against each other.

I would like to respond to my colleagues who have spoken out against this resolution, including Senators Warnock, Warren, Welch, and Whitehouse. While I respect their commitment to environmental protection, I strongly disagree with their assessment that the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species is necessary or justified.

In fact, I believe that this listing is a prime example of federal overreach and an abuse of power. The Endangered Species Act was intended to protect species that are truly endangered, not to impose burdensome regulations on our economy. We should be working to reform this law to ensure that it is used in a responsible and balanced manner, rather than as a tool for environmental extremists to impose their agenda on our country.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and to reject the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened and endangered species. We owe it to our constituents, our economy, and our way of life to take a stand against this overregulation and to fight for common-sense solutions that balance our economic and environmental interests. I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution.

John Kennedy: The lesser prairie-chicken. Now, I'm all for conservation, but we gotta be smart about it. We can't just go around listing every species that's struggling as threatened or endangered without considering the economic implications. I mean, think about all the farmers and ranchers in my state of Louisiana who would be affected by this listing. They're already struggling to make ends meet, and this would just add another layer of bureaucracy and cost to their operations.

Now, I know some of my colleagues are gonna say, "But Senator Kennedy, we gotta protect the environment!" And I agree, we do. But we gotta do it in a way that's balanced and responsible. We can't just sacrifice our economy on the altar of environmentalism. That's not how it works.

I've spoken to folks back in Louisiana, and they're worried about what this listing would mean for their livelihoods. They're worried about the impact on their businesses, their families, and their communities. And I'm worried too. I'm worried that we're gonna push these folks to the brink, and they're gonna have to choose between following the law and putting food on the table.

So, I'm gonna vote in favor of this joint resolution. I think it's a necessary step to ensure that we're taking a balanced approach to conservation. We need to consider the economic implications of our actions, and we need to make sure that we're not harming the very people we're trying to help.

Now, I know some of my colleagues are gonna disagree with me, and that's okay. But I hope they'll consider the long-term benefits and costs of our actions. Let's work together to find solutions that benefit both our economy and our environment. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and our planet to get this right.

So, I'll be voting Yay on this joint resolution. It's the right thing to do for Louisiana, and it's the right thing to do for America.

Rand Paul: The joint resolution before us today seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened and endangered. As a senator from Kentucky, I have always been skeptical of the federal government's tendency to overreach and impose burdensome regulations on our citizens.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who oppose this resolution, I believe that we must consider the potential economic implications of listing the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened and endangered. The Endangered Species Act is a well-intentioned law, but it can often be used as a tool for federal overreach and bureaucratic red tape.

This could include working with state and local governments, private landowners, and other stakeholders to develop conservation plans that are tailored to the specific needs of the species and the affected communities.

In conclusion, I will be voting Yea on this joint resolution.

The listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened and endangered could have significant implications for farmers, ranchers, and other landowners in the affected areas. It could lead to increased regulatory burdens, decreased economic activity, and lost jobs.

As someone who has worked to promote economic growth and job creation in Nebraska, I believe that we must consider the potential economic implications of listing this species.

Bernard Sanders: The joint resolution before us today, which seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened and endangered, is a misguided attempt to undermine the Endangered Species Act and the critical work of conservation.

As a senator from Vermont, I have always been committed to protecting our environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations. The lesser prairie-chicken is a vital species in our ecosystem, and its decline could have significant consequences for our environment and our economy.

I strongly disagree with the arguments made by Senators Marshall, Rounds, and Rubio, who claim that listing the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened and endangered would have significant economic implications for farmers, ranchers, and other landowners.

They argue that the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened and endangered is a necessary step to ensure the long-term survival of this species and that the economic costs of listing the species are significant, but outweighed by the long-term benefits of protecting this species and preserving our ecosystem.

Ultimately, the joint resolution has been passed with a vote of 52-47, with Senators Marshall, Rounds, Rubio, and Tuberville voting in favor of the resolution and Senators Schumer, Schatz, Sanders, and others voting against it. The resolution aims to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened and endangered, and its passage has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and conservation organizations.
