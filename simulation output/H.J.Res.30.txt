Tammy Baldwin: I strongly oppose this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify a crucial Department of Labor rule that allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. As a senator who has consistently championed progressive values and the well-being of American workers, I believe it's essential to recognize the significant impact that climate change and other ESG factors can have on the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans.

By considering these factors, plan fiduciaries can make more informed investment decisions that not only benefit plan participants but also contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future. This rule is a common-sense approach to ensuring that our retirement plans are invested in a way that aligns with the values and interests of American workers.

I'm disappointed, but not surprised, to see my Republican colleagues introducing a bill that would undermine this important rule. It's clear that they are more interested in catering to the interests of corporate special interests than in protecting the financial security of American workers.

As I prepare to cast my vote, I want to make it clear that I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this misguided effort to roll back a critical protection for American workers. We should be working to strengthen our retirement system, not undermining it.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what's the rationale behind nullifying a rule that allows plan fiduciaries to make more informed investment decisions? Don't we want to ensure that our retirement plans are invested in a way that benefits both plan participants and the broader economy?

I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided effort to undermine the financial security of American workers.

John Barrasso: The joint resolution before us today is a crucial step in protecting the financial security of American workers and ensuring that their retirement plans are managed in a responsible and prudent manner. As a senator from Wyoming, I have always been committed to promoting policies that support the interests of my constituents and the American people as a whole.

The Department of Labor rule that this joint resolution seeks to nullify is a clear example of government overreach and an attempt to impose a partisan agenda on the management of employee benefit plans. By allowing plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions, this rule creates a significant risk of politicizing the investment process and undermining the financial security of American workers.

As a member of the Senate, I have a responsibility to protect the interests of my constituents and ensure that their retirement plans are managed in a way that is consistent with their values and goals. This rule, which was issued without adequate input from stakeholders and without a thorough consideration of the potential consequences, is a clear example of regulatory overreach and a threat to the financial security of American workers.

I strongly disagree with my colleague, Senator Baldwin, who suggests that this rule is necessary to protect the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans. In reality, this rule creates a significant risk of politicizing the investment process and undermining the financial security of American workers. By considering climate change and other ESG factors, plan fiduciaries may be tempted to make investment decisions that are based on political ideology rather than sound financial judgment.

I also take issue with Senator Baldwin's suggestion that those of us who support this joint resolution are somehow catering to the interests of corporate special interests. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a senator, I am committed to promoting policies that support the interests of my constituents and the American people as a whole. This joint resolution is a necessary step in protecting the financial security of American workers and ensuring that their retirement plans are managed in a responsible and prudent manner.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution. I believe that it is a necessary step in protecting the financial security of American workers and ensuring that their retirement plans are managed in a responsible and prudent manner. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and rejecting the misguided attempt to impose a partisan agenda on the management of employee benefit plans.

While I understand the intent behind this rule, I also recognize the potential risks of politicizing the investment process and undermining the financial security of American workers.

As a senator who has consistently championed pragmatic and progressive values, I believe that it's essential to strike a balance between promoting sustainable and equitable investments and protecting the financial interests of plan participants. In this case, I am concerned that the rule may create unintended consequences, such as encouraging plan fiduciaries to make investment decisions based on political ideology rather than sound financial judgment.

I appreciate the arguments made by my colleagues, Senator Baldwin and Senator Barrasso. Senator Baldwin's passion for promoting sustainable and equitable investments is admirable, and I share her commitment to protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans. However, I also understand Senator Barrasso's concerns about the potential risks of politicizing the investment process and the need to protect the financial security of American workers.

Cory A. Booker: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of the importance of protecting the financial security of American workers and ensuring that their retirement plans are managed in a responsible and prudent manner.

I understand the concerns raised by my colleagues, Senators Barrasso, Bennet, and Blackburn, about the potential risks of politicizing the investment process and undermining the financial security of American workers. However, I believe that these concerns are overstated and that the benefits of considering ESG factors far outweigh the risks.

In fact, many of the largest and most successful investment firms in the world already consider ESG factors when making investment decisions, and it has been shown to have a positive impact on long-term financial returns. Furthermore, ignoring ESG factors can lead to significant financial risks, such as stranded assets and climate-related losses.

As a senator from New York, I have seen firsthand the impact of climate change on our economy and the importance of considering environmental factors in investment decisions. I believe that plan fiduciaries should be able to make informed investment decisions that take into account the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy.

I disagree with my colleagues, Senators Daines, Ernst, Fischer, and others, who argue that this rule creates a significant risk of politicizing the investment process and undermining the financial security of American workers. In reality, this rule is a prudent and responsible approach to investment decision-making, one that recognizes the importance of considering ESG factors in making informed investment decisions.

I would like to respond to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential risks of politicizing the investment process. I understand their concerns, but I believe that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans.

Let us work together to strengthen our retirement system and protect the financial security of American workers. Let us reject this misguided attempt to impose a partisan agenda on the management of employee benefit plans and ensure that our retirement plans are invested in a way that benefits plan participants, rather than being used to advance a partisan agenda.

I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in protecting the financial security of American workers by rejecting this misguided attempt to impose a partisan agenda on the management of employee benefit plans.

To my colleagues who support this rule, I ask: don't we want to ensure that our retirement plans are invested in a way that benefits plan participants, rather than being used to advance a partisan agenda?

Let us work together to strengthen our retirement system and protect the financial security of American workers.

I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, about the potential risks of politicizing the investment process.

As a senator from Massachusetts, I believe that the Department of Labor rule in question is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy. Considering ESG factors, including climate change, is not only a prudent approach to investment decision-making, but it's also a recognition of the significant risks and opportunities that climate change poses to our economy.

As a senator from Kentucky, I have always been committed to promoting policies that support the interests of American workers and the economy.

The Department of Labor rule in question allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. While I understand the intentions behind this rule, I strongly believe that it goes too far in allowing plan fiduciaries to consider factors that may not be in the best interest of plan participants.

In response to Senator Lujan, I must respectfully disagree with his assertion that this rule is necessary to protect the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy. While I understand the importance of considering ESG factors, I believe that this rule is not the right approach. Instead, we should be working to strengthen our retirement system and protect the financial security of American workers through more effective and efficient means.

In response to Senator Markey, I must also respectfully disagree with his assertion that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy.

Robert Menendez: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify a Department of Labor rule that allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. As a senator from New Jersey, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of climate change on our communities and our economy. Rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and extreme weather events are just a few examples of the many risks that climate change poses to our financial security.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues, Senators Lummis, Manchin, and McConnell, who argue that this rule is a prime example of regulatory overreach. On the contrary, I believe that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy. By allowing plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors, we can ensure that our retirement plans are invested in a way that benefits both plan participants and the environment.

I also take issue with the argument that this rule is a partisan attempt to impose a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries. As a Democrat, I believe that it is our responsibility to protect the financial security of American workers and to promote policies that support the long-term health of our economy. This rule is not about advancing a partisan agenda; it is about making informed investment decisions that take into account the very real risks and opportunities posed by climate change.

I would like to respond to Senator Lummis's comment that plan fiduciaries are capable of making informed investment decisions without considering ESG factors. I agree that plan fiduciaries are capable of making informed decisions, but I believe that they should have the flexibility to consider all relevant factors, including ESG factors, when making investment decisions. This rule does not require plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors, but rather allows them to do so if they determine that it is in the best interest of plan participants.

I would also like to address Senator Manchin's comment that this rule could lead to investment decisions that are based on political ideology rather than sound financial judgment. I understand Senator Manchin's concerns, but I believe that this rule is designed to promote sound financial judgment, not to advance a partisan agenda. By allowing plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors, we can ensure that our retirement plans are invested in a way that benefits plan participants and promotes long-term financial health.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and to support the Department of Labor rule that allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other ESG factors when making investment decisions. This rule is a necessary step in protecting the financial security of American workers and promoting the long-term health of our economy. I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this misguided attempt to roll back a critical protection for American workers.

Lisa Murkowski: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of my commitment to protecting the financial security of American workers and ensuring that their retirement plans are managed in a responsible and prudent manner.

While I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues, Senators Marshall, McConnell, and Moran, about the potential risks of politicizing the investment process, I believe that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy.

Christopher Murphy: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of my commitment to protecting the financial security of American workers and ensuring that their retirement plans are managed in a responsible and prudent manner. However, I strongly disagree with the notion that this rule, which allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions, is a partisan attempt to impose a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries.

As a senator from Connecticut, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of climate change on our communities and our economy. Rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and extreme weather events are just a few examples of the many risks that climate change poses to our financial security. It is essential that plan fiduciaries are able to consider these risks when making investment decisions, and this rule allows them to do so in a way that benefits both plan participants and the environment.

I take issue with the argument that this rule is a prime example of regulatory overreach. On the contrary, I believe that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy. By allowing plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors, we can ensure that our retirement plans are invested in a way that benefits plan participants and promotes long-term financial health.

I also disagree with the notion that plan fiduciaries are capable of making informed investment decisions without considering ESG factors. While plan fiduciaries are certainly capable of making informed decisions, I believe that they should have the flexibility to consider all relevant factors, including ESG factors, when making investment decisions. This rule does not require plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors, but rather allows them to do so if they determine that it is in the best interest of plan participants.

In response to my colleagues who support this joint resolution, I ask: don't we want to ensure that our retirement plans are invested in a way that benefits plan participants, rather than being used to advance a partisan agenda? Don't we want to protect the financial security of American workers, rather than exposing them to the risks of short-sighted investment decisions? I believe that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the financial security of American workers and promoting the long-term health of our economy.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and to support the Department of Labor rule that allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other ESG factors when making investment decisions. This rule is a necessary step in protecting the financial security of American workers and promoting the long-term health of our economy. I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution.

Brian Schatz: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify a Department of Labor rule that allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. As a senator from Hawaii, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of climate change on our communities and our economy.

I've listened to my colleagues, Senators Sullivan, Thune, Tillis, and Tuberville, and I respectfully disagree with their assessment of the rule. I think it's a common-sense approach to protecting the financial security of American workers and promoting the long-term health of our economy. By considering climate change and other ESG factors, plan fiduciaries can make more informed investment decisions that align with the values of their participants and promote long-term financial health.

I understand that some of my colleagues may argue that this rule is an example of regulatory overreach, but I disagree. I think it's a responsible and prudent approach to managing retirement plans, and it's in line with the values of transparency, accountability, and sustainability that we should be promoting in our economy.

Richard Blumenthal: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify a Department of Labor rule that allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. As a senator from Connecticut, I believe that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy.

I've listened to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I must say that I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by the partisan divide on this issue. I think it's a common-sense approach to protecting the financial security of American workers and promoting the long-term health of our economy. By considering climate change and other ESG factors, plan fiduciaries can make more informed investment decisions that align with the values of their participants and promote long-term financial health.

I'm concerned that nullifying this rule would ultimately harm the very people it's intended to help - American workers and retirees who rely on these retirement plans for their financial security. I'm also concerned that this joint resolution is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to cater to the interests of corporate special interests and wealthy donors, rather than prioritizing the financial security of American workers.

I'd like to address the comments made by Senators Young, Barrasso, and Blackburn, who argue that this rule would impose a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and support the Department of Labor rule that allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other ESG factors when making investment decisions. This rule is a crucial step in ensuring that our retirement plans are invested in a way that aligns with our values and promotes long-term financial health.

Bill Cassidy: I rise today to express my thoughts on the joint resolution before us, which seeks to nullify the Department of Labor rule allowing plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. As a senator from Louisiana, I have to consider the potential impact of this rule on the financial security of American workers and the long-term health of our economy.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who argue that this rule is an example of regulatory overreach, I believe that it's essential to consider the potential benefits of allowing plan fiduciaries to make more informed investment decisions. Climate change and other ESG factors can have significant impacts on the long-term financial health of companies and, by extension, the retirement plans that invest in them.

However, I also have to consider the potential risks of imposing a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries. As a conservative Republican, I believe in free market principles and limited government intervention in the economy. I'm concerned that this rule could lead to plan fiduciaries making investment decisions based on political ideology rather than sound financial principles.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of the joint resolution.

Angus S. King Jr.: As I consider this joint resolution, I must say that I strongly oppose the effort to nullify the Department of Labor rule that allows plan fiduciaries to consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. As an independent senator from Maine, I believe that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Hirono, Kaine, and Kelly, who have argued that this rule is a common-sense approach to managing retirement plans, and it allows plan fiduciaries to make informed investment decisions that take into account the long-term risks and opportunities associated with climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors.

As someone who has consistently advocated for responsible management of our environment and economy, I believe that considering climate change and other ESG factors is not only a sound investment strategy but also a moral imperative. We have a responsibility to ensure that our investment decisions align with our values and promote a sustainable future for all Americans.

I must respectfully disagree with the assessments of my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, Johnson, and Kennedy, who argue that this rule is an example of regulatory overreach and an attempt to impose a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries. I believe that this rule is a neutral and apolitical approach to managing retirement plans, and it is essential for protecting the financial security of American workers and promoting the long-term health of our economy.

Let us stand together to protect the financial security of American workers and promote the long-term health of our economy by rejecting this rule and preserving the freedom of plan fiduciaries to make investment decisions based on sound financial principles.

Marco Rubio: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Department of Labor rule concerning the fiduciary duties with respect to employee benefit plans, I must say that I strongly support this resolution. As a senator from Florida, I believe that this rule is an example of regulatory overreach and an attempt to impose a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Rand Paul, Pete Ricketts, and James E. Risch, who have argued that this rule is a clear example of the government trying to dictate how private investment decisions should be made. I believe that plan fiduciaries should be making investment decisions based on the best interests of their clients, not on some arbitrary environmental or social agenda.

As a conservative, I believe in the power of the free market and the importance of keeping government intervention to a minimum. This rule is a perfect example of the government trying to pick winners and losers, and it's not the role of the government to do so.

I'm also concerned that this rule could lead to a situation where plan fiduciaries are prioritizing political correctness over financial returns. That's not what retirement plans are for. They're meant to provide a secure financial future for American workers, not to advance a particular ideological agenda.

I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Senators Gary Peters, Jack Reed, and others, who argue that this rule is a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy. I believe that this rule is a solution in search of a problem, and it's not necessary to protect the financial security of American workers.

In light of this, I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to think about the long-term consequences of our actions and to prioritize the financial security of American workers and the long-term health of our economy. We should be working to promote free market principles and reduce government intervention in the economy, not expanding it.

In particular, I'd like to respond to Senator Jacky Rosen's comments. While I understand her concerns about the potential impact of this rule on the financial security of American workers, I believe that her concerns are misplaced. This rule is not a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy. Instead, it's an example of government overreach and an attempt to impose a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries.

I also want to address the comments made by Senator Mitt Romney. While I understand his concerns about the potential impact of this rule on the financial security of American workers, I believe that his concerns are overstated. This rule is not a neutral and apolitical approach to managing retirement plans, but rather an attempt to impose a particular ideological agenda on plan fiduciaries.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support the joint resolution and nullify the Department of Labor rule. I believe that this is a necessary step in protecting the financial security of American workers and promoting the long-term health of our economy. I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting it.

Bernard Sanders: The joint resolution before us today is a perfect example of the Republican Party's misguided priorities. They claim to be concerned about the financial security of American workers, but in reality, they are simply trying to undermine the ability of plan fiduciaries to make informed investment decisions that take into account the long-term risks and opportunities associated with climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors.

As a democratic socialist, I believe that it is essential to consider the broader social and environmental implications of our investment decisions. Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and it is absurd to suggest that plan fiduciaries should not be able to consider its potential impact on their investments.

The Department of Labor rule that this joint resolution seeks to nullify is a common-sense approach to managing retirement plans. It allows plan fiduciaries to make informed investment decisions that take into account the long-term risks and opportunities associated with climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues, Senators Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, who argue that this rule is an example of regulatory overreach and an attempt to impose a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries. This rule is not a solution in search of a problem, but rather a necessary step in protecting the long-term financial health of employee benefit plans and the broader economy.

I also disagree with their claim that this rule could lead to a situation where plan fiduciaries are prioritizing political correctness over financial returns. This is a red herring, and it ignores the fact that considering climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors is a sound investment strategy that can help to mitigate risks and identify opportunities for long-term growth.

In light of this, I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to think about the long-term consequences of our actions and to prioritize the financial security of American workers and the long-term health of our economy. We should be working to promote responsible investment practices and considering the long-term risks and opportunities associated with climate change, rather than undermining them.

It allows plan fiduciaries to make informed investment decisions that take into account the long-term risks and opportunities associated with climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors.

As someone who has consistently advocated for responsible management of our environment and economy, I believe that considering climate change and other ESG factors is not only a sound investment strategy but also a moral imperative. We have a responsibility to ensure that our investment decisions align with our values and promote a sustainable future for all Americans.

I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Senators Mike Rounds, Marco Rubio, and others, who argue that this rule is an example of regulatory overreach and an attempt to impose a liberal agenda on plan fiduciaries.
