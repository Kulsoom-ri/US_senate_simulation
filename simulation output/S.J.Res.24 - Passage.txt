Tammy Baldwin: As I consider this joint resolution, I must express my strong opposition to nullifying the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reclassify the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species. This decision was made after careful consideration and consultation with experts, and it's essential that we prioritize the conservation and protection of this species.

The northern long-eared bat is facing significant threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and the devastating impact of white-nose syndrome, which has already killed millions of bats across North America. By reclassifying the species as endangered, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is taking a crucial step to ensure its survival.

I understand that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule, but I firmly believe that we must balance our economic interests with our responsibility to protect the environment and preserve biodiversity. The Endangered Species Act is a critical tool in our efforts to conserve and protect threatened and endangered species, and we must not undermine its effectiveness.

I also want to note that this resolution is being considered under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and overturn regulatory actions with a simple majority vote. While I respect the intent of this law, I believe that it can be misused to undermine important environmental protections and scientific decisions.

In light of these considerations, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work together to find solutions that balance our economic and environmental interests. We owe it to future generations to protect our natural heritage and preserve the beauty and diversity of our planet.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what is the urgency behind nullifying this rule? What evidence do we have that the reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species will have a significant economic impact? I believe that we must carefully consider the consequences of our actions and ensure that we are not prioritizing short-term gains over long-term environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing this measure. We must prioritize the protection of our environment and the conservation of our natural resources, and I believe that this resolution takes us in the wrong direction.

John Barrasso: As I consider this joint resolution, I must express my strong support for nullifying the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reclassify the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species. While I understand the concerns about the conservation and protection of this species, I believe that this rule will have significant economic impacts on my home state of Wyoming and other states with similar industries.

As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the importance of responsible land management and the impact that overregulation can have on our economy. The reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species will undoubtedly lead to increased regulatory burdens on our energy, mining, and forestry industries, which are critical to the economic well-being of our state.

I also question the timing of this rule, which was issued without adequate consideration of the potential economic consequences. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species, and I believe that this decision was made without adequate consultation with stakeholders and experts.

Regarding Senator Baldwin's comments, I must respectfully disagree with her assertion that we must prioritize the conservation and protection of this species without considering the economic impacts. As a nation, we have a responsibility to balance our economic interests with our environmental responsibilities, and I believe that this rule fails to achieve that balance.

To Senator Baldwin, I would ask: what evidence do we have that the reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species will actually lead to its conservation and protection? What measures will be taken to address the root causes of the decline of this species, such as habitat loss and white-nose syndrome? I believe that we must carefully consider the consequences of our actions and ensure that we are not simply imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on our industries.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. We must prioritize responsible land management and balance our economic interests with our environmental responsibilities. I believe that this resolution is a necessary step to ensure that we are not undermining the economic well-being of our states and industries without achieving meaningful conservation benefits.

Tammy Duckworth: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reclassify the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species. As a senator from Illinois and a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I have carefully considered the potential impacts of this rule, and I firmly believe that it is a necessary step to protect this iconic species.

The northern long-eared bat is facing significant threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and disease. The white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease, has already devastated bat populations across the country, and the reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species is a critical step to ensure its survival.

I understand that some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule, but I believe that these concerns are overstated. The Endangered Species Act has been in place for decades, and it has been shown time and time again to be a effective tool for protecting species and their habitats.

Furthermore, I believe that the economic benefits of protecting the northern long-eared bat far outweigh any potential costs. Bats play a crucial role in our ecosystem, and their loss could have significant impacts on our agriculture, forestry, and tourism industries.

I also want to address the argument that this rule was issued without adequate consideration of the potential economic consequences. I disagree with this assessment. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a thorough review of the potential impacts of this rule, and it determined that the benefits of protecting the northern long-eared bat outweigh any potential costs.

In conclusion, I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution. I believe that the reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species is a necessary step to protect this iconic species, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution.

But let us not undermine the Endangered Species Act and the critical work of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by nullifying this rule. The future of the northern long-eared bat and our planet depends on it.

In response to my colleagues who support this resolution, I urge you to consider the long-term benefits of conservation and the potential costs of inaction. Let us work together to find a balanced approach that protects both our economy and our environment. But let us not undermine the Endangered Species Act and the critical work of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by nullifying this rule. The future of the northern long-eared bat and our planet depends on it.

I also believe that the economic benefits of protecting the northern long-eared bat far outweigh any potential costs. Bats play a crucial role in our ecosystem, and their loss could have significant impacts on our agriculture, forestry, and tourism industries. In Pennsylvania, we have a strong tradition of conservation and environmental protection, and I believe that we must continue to prioritize the protection of our natural resources.

I understand that some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule, but I believe that these concerns are overstated.

I am willing to work with my colleagues to find ways to mitigate any potential economic impacts of this rule and to ensure that we are not undermining the economic well-being of our states and industries without achieving meaningful conservation benefits.

Jon Tester: As I consider this joint resolution, I must say that I'm torn. On one hand, I understand the concerns of my colleagues who believe that the reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species could have significant economic impacts on certain industries, particularly in the agriculture and forestry sectors. As a senator from Montana, I've seen firsthand the importance of balancing environmental protection with economic development.

On the other hand, I also believe that we have a responsibility to protect our natural resources and the environment. The Endangered Species Act has been in place for decades, and it's been shown to be an effective tool for protecting species and their habitats. I agree with my colleagues who have emphasized the importance of conservation and the need to prioritize the protection of our environment.

As someone who has worked on issues related to rural communities and the economy, I believe that we can find ways to balance our economic interests with our environmental responsibilities. However, I'm not convinced that nullifying the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the right approach.

I'd like to respond to Senator Sullivan's comment about taking a nuanced approach to this issue. I agree that we need to consider the potential economic impacts of this rule, but I also believe that we need to take a long-term view and consider the potential consequences of our actions. If we fail to protect the northern long-eared bat and other endangered species, we'll be leaving a devastated planet for future generations.

I'd like to propose a compromise. Instead of nullifying the final rule, let's work together to find ways to mitigate any potential economic impacts of this rule and to ensure that we're not undermining the economic well-being of our states and industries without achieving meaningful conservation benefits. I'm willing to work with my colleagues to find solutions that support both our environment and our economy.

In conclusion, I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution. I believe that the reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species is a necessary step to protect this iconic species, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution. However, I'm also committed to finding ways to balance our economic interests with our environmental responsibilities, and I look forward to continuing this conversation about how we can achieve that balance.

Tammy Baldwin: As I consider this joint resolution, I must express my strong opposition to nullifying the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reclassify the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always been committed to protecting our natural resources and the environment, and I believe that this reclassification is a necessary step to ensure the conservation of this iconic species.

The northern long-eared bat is facing significant threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and disease, and its population has been declining dramatically. The Endangered Species Act is a critical tool for protecting species like the northern long-eared bat, and it has a proven track record of success in recovering species that are on the brink of extinction.

John Kennedy: The northern long-eared bat. Now, I'm all for protecting our environment and conserving species, but we gotta be realistic here. This joint resolution is about nullifying a rule that could have significant economic impacts on our states and industries.

As a senator from Louisiana, I know that our state has a strong agricultural heritage and a significant energy industry. We can't just ignore the potential economic impacts of this rule on our farmers, our foresters, and our energy producers.

I've also heard from Senators Kaine and Kelly, who are opposed to this resolution. I understand their concerns, but I think they're being a bit too idealistic.

Now, I know some of my colleagues might say that this resolution is a giveaway to special interests, but I don't see it that way. I see it as a necessary step to protect the economic interests of our states and industries. And I'm willing to work with my colleagues to find ways to mitigate any potential economic impacts of this rule and to ensure that we're not undermining the economic well-being of our states and industries without achieving meaningful conservation benefits.

So, after careful consideration, I've decided to vote "yes" on this joint resolution.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. Let's find a balance between protecting the environment and supporting our economy. That's the Louisiana way, and that's the American way.

Markwayne Mullin: As the sponsor of this joint resolution, I'm pleased to see the debate unfolding on the Senate floor. I'd like to address some of the concerns raised by my colleagues, particularly those from Senators Markey, Menendez, and Merkley, who have expressed opposition to this resolution.

While I understand their commitment to environmental protection, I must respectfully disagree with their assessment of the situation. The final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which reclassifies the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species, has significant economic implications for our states and industries. The forestry and agriculture sectors, which are crucial to the economies of many states, including Oklahoma, will be disproportionately affected by this rule.

I'm not suggesting that we shouldn't protect the northern long-eared bat. However, we must consider the long-term consequences of this rule and find a balance between environmental protection and economic interests. The current rule, as written, will lead to unnecessary burdens on our farmers, foresters, and energy producers, ultimately harming the very economy that we're trying to protect.

I'd like to respond to Senator Markey's comment about prioritizing the interests of industries over the well-being of our environment. I believe that's a false dichotomy. We can protect the environment while also supporting our economic interests. In fact, many of our farmers and foresters are also stewards of the land and have a vested interest in preserving the natural resources that sustain their livelihoods.

I appreciate the comments from Senators Marshall, McConnell, and Moran, who have highlighted the need to find a balance between environmental protection and economic interests. I believe that this joint resolution is a step in the right direction, as it nullifies a rule that could have significant economic impacts on our states and industries.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of this rule and the need to find a balance between environmental protection and economic interests. I believe that nullifying the final rule is a necessary step to protect the economic interests of our states and industries, while also considering the long-term benefits of conserving the northern long-eared bat. I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this effort to find a more balanced approach to environmental protection.

As a senator who has always been committed to finding common-sense solutions, I believe that we can find a balance between protecting the northern long-eared bat and supporting our forestry and agriculture industries.

We have a strong tradition of environmental stewardship, and we've made significant strides in conserving our natural resources while also promoting economic growth.

I would like to propose an amendment to this joint resolution that would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to conduct a thorough economic analysis of the potential impacts of the final rule on our states and industries. This would provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences of this rule and allow us to find a more balanced approach to protecting the northern long-eared bat. I hope that my colleagues will consider this proposal and work with me to find a solution that benefits both our environment and our economy.

As a senator from a state with a strong commitment to environmental protection, I believe that conserving this species is crucial for maintaining the health of our ecosystem.

I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues about the potential economic impacts of this rule, particularly in the forestry and agriculture sectors. However, I also believe that we must consider the long-term benefits of conserving this species. The northern long-eared bat plays a vital role in our ecosystem, and its decline could have significant implications for our environment and economy.

I appreciate the thoughtful comments from Senators Van Hollen, Warner, and others who have highlighted the importance of protecting our environment and conserving our natural resources. I share their concerns about the potential consequences of this joint resolution and believe that we must prioritize the health of our planet and the well-being of our citizens over the interests of special interests and industries.

In Vermont, we have a strong tradition of environmental stewardship, and we've made significant strides in conserving our natural resources while also promoting economic growth. I believe that we can find a balance between protecting the northern long-eared bat and supporting our industries, and I will continue to work towards finding a solution that works for our state's economy and our environment.

Therefore, I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this misguided effort to undermine our environmental protections and to work towards a future that prioritizes the health of our planet and the well-being of our citizens.

To my colleagues who are supporting this joint resolution, I would say that I understand their concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule. However, I believe that we must take a closer look at the potential long-term consequences of nullifying this rule and work towards finding a balanced approach that takes into account both environmental and economic concerns. I am willing to work with my colleagues to find a solution that works for all of us, but I will not support efforts to undermine our environmental protections without careful consideration of the potential consequences.

As a nation, we have a moral obligation to protect our planet and preserve its natural beauty for future generations. Let us not forget the importance of taking action to preserve our environment and conserve our natural resources. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this joint resolution and to work towards a future that prioritizes the health of our planet and the well-being of our citizens.

Sheldon Whitehouse: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of the critical importance of protecting our environment and conserving species like the northern long-eared bat. As a senator from Rhode Island, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of environmental degradation and the importance of taking action to preserve our natural resources.

I must say that I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the introduction of this joint resolution. It is yet another attempt by my Republican colleagues to undermine the Endangered Species Act and prioritize the interests of special interests and industries over the health of our planet and the well-being of our citizens.

The northern long-eared bat plays a vital role in our ecosystem, and its decline could have significant implications for our environment and economy. By nullifying the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, we would be undermining the very protections that are in place to conserve this species and maintain the health of our ecosystem.

Roger F. Wicker: The joint resolution before us today seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which reclassifies the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species. As a senator from Mississippi, I have to consider the potential economic impacts of this rule on our state's forestry and agriculture sectors.

While I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues about the importance of protecting the environment and conserving species, I also believe that we must take a balanced approach that considers the economic implications of this rule. The forestry and agriculture industries are vital to Mississippi's economy, and we must ensure that any regulations or protections put in place do not unduly burden these industries.

I appreciate the comments from my colleagues who have highlighted the importance of protecting the environment, but I must respectfully disagree with their decision to oppose this joint resolution. I believe that nullifying this rule is necessary to prevent unnecessary economic harm to our state's industries.
