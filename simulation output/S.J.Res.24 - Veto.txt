Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, S.J.Res.24, aims to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that reclassifies the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always been committed to protecting our environment and preserving the natural beauty of our state.

However, I strongly disagree with the approach taken by this joint resolution. The Endangered Species Act is a crucial tool for protecting species that are at risk of extinction, and the decision to list the northern long-eared bat as endangered was made after careful consideration by scientists and experts.

By voting to override the President's veto, we would be undermining the authority of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and disregarding the scientific consensus on the need to protect this species. I believe that we should be working to strengthen our environmental protections, not weaken them.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the impact that this resolution could have on the health of our ecosystems and the biodiversity of our state. The northern long-eared bat plays a crucial role in controlling insect populations, and its decline could have significant consequences for our agriculture and forestry industries.

For these reasons, I will be voting against the motion to override the President's veto. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and instead work towards finding solutions that balance our economic and environmental interests.

I would like to address the concerns of my colleagues who may be worried about the economic impact of listing the northern long-eared bat as endangered. I believe that we can find ways to support our industries while also protecting our environment. We should be working to provide assistance to farmers and landowners who may be affected by the listing, and to develop strategies for mitigating any potential economic impacts.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the joint resolution before us today and urge my colleagues to join me in voting against it. We should be working to protect our environment and preserve the natural beauty of our state, not undermining the authority of our environmental agencies and disregarding the scientific consensus on the need to protect endangered species.

John Barrasso: As I stand here today, I am compelled to express my strong support for overriding the President's veto of S.J.Res.24. This joint resolution aims to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that reclassifies the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act.

I understand that my colleague, Senator Tammy Baldwin, has raised concerns about the potential impact of this resolution on the environment and the economy. However, I must respectfully disagree with her assessment. The Endangered Species Act is a vital tool for protecting species that are at risk of extinction, but it must be applied in a way that balances environmental concerns with economic realities.

In this case, the reclassification of the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species could have significant economic implications for industries such as forestry, mining, and agriculture. These industries are crucial to the economy of my home state of Wyoming, and I will not stand idly by while they are threatened by overly broad and burdensome regulations.

I also take issue with the notion that the decision to list the northern long-eared bat as endangered was made after careful consideration by scientists and experts. While I have the utmost respect for the scientific community, I believe that the listing process was rushed and did not take into account the full range of economic and social impacts.

Furthermore, I am concerned that the listing of the northern long-eared bat as endangered could set a dangerous precedent for the listing of other species in the future. If we allow the Endangered Species Act to be used as a tool for imposing draconian regulations on American businesses and industries, we risk stifling economic growth and undermining the very fabric of our economy.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to override the President's veto of S.J.Res.24. This resolution is a necessary step towards ensuring that the Endangered Species Act is applied in a way that balances environmental concerns with economic realities. We must work to protect our environment, but we must do so in a way that does not harm the very people and industries that we are trying to help.

To Senator Baldwin, I would say that I understand and respect her commitment to environmental protection, but I believe that we can find ways to support our industries while also protecting our environment. I am willing to work with her and other colleagues to find solutions that balance our economic and environmental interests, but I will not support measures that undermine the authority of Congress and impose unnecessary burdens on American businesses and industries.

Michael F. Bennet: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, S.J.Res.24, I must weigh the competing interests of environmental protection and economic development.

I agree with Senator Baldwin that we should be working to strengthen our environmental protections, not weaken them. The northern long-eared bat plays a crucial role in controlling insect populations, and its decline could have significant consequences for our agriculture and forestry industries.

However, I also believe that we can find ways to support our industries while also protecting our environment. As a pragmatic progressive, I am committed to seeking solutions that balance our economic and environmental interests.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the motion to override the President's veto. I believe that we should be working to protect our environment and preserve the natural beauty of our state, not undermining the authority of our environmental agencies and disregarding the scientific consensus on the need to protect endangered species.

To my colleagues, I urge you to consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We must work to find solutions that balance our economic and environmental interests, and I am willing to work with anyone who shares this goal. But I will not support measures that undermine the authority of our environmental agencies and impose unnecessary burdens on American businesses and industries.

In conclusion, I will be voting against the joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution. Let us work together to find solutions that protect our environment and support our industries, rather than pitting one against the other.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to list the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species is a crucial step in protecting this species and preserving the delicate balance of our ecosystem. I understand that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the potential economic impacts of listing the species, but I believe that the potential environmental benefits outweigh the potential costs.

I must respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Senators Cramer, Crapo, Cruz, and Daines, who prioritize economic concerns over environmental realities. While I understand the importance of supporting our industries, I believe that we must take a more nuanced approach to conservation, one that balances environmental concerns with economic realities.

In response to my colleagues' comments, I appreciate their thoughtful consideration of the issue, but I must emphasize that the Endangered Species Act is a vital tool for protecting species that are at risk of extinction. We must not undermine this crucial legislation, which has been instrumental in protecting countless species and preserving the health of our ecosystems.

Rand Paul: The joint resolution before us today, S.J.Res.24, is a clear example of the federal government overstepping its bounds. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to list the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species is a prime example of the kind of bureaucratic overreach that I have always spoken out against.

I understand that some of my colleagues may believe that this listing is necessary to protect the species, but I strongly disagree.

We need to take a more nuanced approach to conservation and environmental protection, one that balances our commitment to protecting the environment with our commitment to protecting our economy and our way of life.

I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of overriding the President's veto of S.J.Res.24. Let's stand up for our economy, our jobs, and our way of life. Let's take a more balanced approach to conservation and environmental protection, and let's make sure that we are not sacrificing our economic well-being on the altar of environmental extremism.

Pete Ricketts: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, S.J.Res.24, I must weigh the competing interests of environmental protection and economic development. As a senator from Nebraska, I have always been committed to preserving the natural beauty of our state and protecting the health of our ecosystems.

However, I also understand the importance of supporting our industries, particularly agriculture, which is a vital part of Nebraska's economy. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to list the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species could have significant consequences for our farmers and ranchers.

I appreciate the thoughtful consideration of the issue by my colleagues, but I must respectfully disagree with those who prioritize environmental concerns over economic realities.

Bernard Sanders: My fellow senators, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the joint resolution before us, S.J.Res.24. This resolution would nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species.

As a senator from Vermont, I have seen firsthand the importance of preserving our natural resources and protecting our environment. The northern long-eared bat plays a crucial role in our ecosystem, and its loss would have significant consequences for our environment and our economy.

Furthermore, the Endangered Species Act has been incredibly successful in recovering species and protecting our natural heritage.
