In reaction to the comments from my colleagues, I agree that we must work towards a more permanent and sustainable solution to our nation's funding needs. I appreciate their concerns about the temporary nature of this solution and the need for more comprehensive and responsible funding decisions.

As a senator from North Dakota, I am particularly interested in the provisions that affect our state's communities, including the extension of funding for the Dairy Margin Coverage program, which is vital to our nation's dairy farmers.

John Kennedy: The Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024.  Well, I've got to tell you, I'm not thrilled about this bill, but I'm going to vote for it anyway.  As a fiscal conservative, I believe we should be passing comprehensive appropriations bills, not relying on short-term continuing resolutions.  But I also know that a government shutdown would be disastrous, so I'm willing to hold my nose and vote for this bill.

I've got to say, I'm disappointed that we're not taking a more responsible approach to funding our government.  We should be making tough decisions about where to allocate our resources, rather than just kicking the can down the road with another continuing resolution.  But I understand that's not the reality we're dealing with right now.

I do appreciate the fact that this bill extends several critical programs, including the Dairy Margin Coverage program and the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program.  These programs are important for our nation's farmers and ranchers, and I'm glad we're able to provide them with some certainty.

I also want to commend my colleagues for their hard work on this bill.  I know we don't all agree on the best way to fund our government, but I think we all share a commitment to doing what's best for the American people.  And I appreciate the efforts of Senators Hyde-Smith, Johnson, Kaine, and Kelly to find common ground and move this bill forward.

In reaction to my colleagues' comments, I agree that we need to work towards a more permanent and sustainable solution to our nation's funding needs.  We can't keep relying on short-term continuing resolutions and expect to get the best results for the American people.  I'm willing to work with anyone who's serious about finding a better way forward, and I hope we can make some progress on that in the coming months.

So, I'll be voting yes on this bill, but I'll also be pushing for more responsible and comprehensive funding decisions in the future.  We owe it to the American people to do better, and I'm committed to making that happen.

Jon Tester: As I consider the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024, I must weigh the importance of preventing a government shutdown against the need for more comprehensive and responsible funding decisions. As a senator from Montana and a strong advocate for rural interests, I am particularly interested in the provisions that affect our nation's agriculture, rural communities, and public health programs.

While I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to include extensions of critical programs, such as the Dairy Margin Coverage program and the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program, I am concerned about the temporary nature of this solution. Continuing resolutions are not a substitute for responsible and comprehensive funding decisions. We should prioritize passing comprehensive appropriations bills that address the long-term needs of our country, rather than relying on short-term continuing resolutions.

Regarding the amendment proposed by Senator Paul, which aimed to reduce continuing funding by 15 percent and rescind $30 billion from enforcement funds provided to the Internal Revenue Service, I must express my strong disagreement. Such drastic cuts would have severe consequences for many critical programs and services, including those that support our nation's most vulnerable populations.

However, I do agree with Senator Paul that we need to take a closer look at our nation's spending and work towards more responsible and comprehensive funding decisions. As a senator from a state with a strong agricultural industry, I believe it is essential to ensure that our farmers and ranchers receive the support they need to thrive.

I will vote in favor of this bill because it provides necessary funding for critical programs and services, and it prevents a government shutdown. However, I will continue to advocate for more responsible and comprehensive funding decisions that prioritize the long-term needs of our nation and its people.

In reaction to the comments from my colleagues, I agree that we must work towards a more permanent and sustainable solution to our nation's funding needs.

Ultimately, my vote in favor of this bill is a pragmatic decision to prevent a government shutdown and ensure the continued operation of essential programs and services. Nevertheless, I will continue to advocate for more responsible and comprehensive funding decisions that prioritize the long-term needs of our nation and its people. I will vote yes on this bill.

In response to my colleagues, I would like to say that I appreciate the thoughtful comments from Senators Schatz, Schmitt, Schumer, and Scott.

I would like to address Senator Scott's comments about the need for fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention.

Sheldon Whitehouse: As I consider the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024, I must weigh the importance of preventing a government shutdown against the need for more comprehensive and responsible funding decisions. As a senator from Rhode Island and a strong advocate for Democratic values, I am particularly interested in the provisions that affect our nation's agriculture, rural communities, and public health programs.

As a senator from Pennsylvania and a strong advocate for Democratic values, I am particularly interested in the provisions that affect our nation's agriculture, rural communities, and public health programs.

While I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to include extensions of critical programs, such as the Dairy Margin Coverage program and the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program, I am concerned about the temporary nature of this solution. Continuing resolutions are not a substitute for responsible and comprehensive funding decisions. We should prioritize passing comprehensive appropriations bills that address the long-term needs of our country, rather than relying on short-term continuing resolutions.

I strongly disagree with the amendment proposed by Senator Paul, which aimed to reduce continuing funding by 15 percent and rescind $30 billion from enforcement funds provided to the Internal Revenue Service. Such drastic cuts would have severe consequences for many critical programs and services, including those that support our nation's most vulnerable populations.

However, I also believe that we must be mindful of our nation's fiscal situation and work towards reducing our deficit and promoting economic growth. I agree with my colleagues, including Senators Collins, Coons, and Cortez Masto, that we must work towards a more permanent and sustainable solution to our nation's funding needs.

Ultimately, my vote in favor of this bill is a pragmatic decision to prevent a government shutdown and ensure the continued operation of essential programs and services. Nevertheless, I will continue to advocate for more responsible and comprehensive funding decisions that prioritize the long-term needs of our nation and its people.

As a senator from Pennsylvania, I am particularly interested in the provisions that affect our state's agriculture, small businesses, and public health programs.

As I vote in favor of this bill, I am reminded of the importance of protecting the most vulnerable members of our society, including low-income families, children, and the elderly. I will continue to fight for policies that support American workers, promote economic growth, and ensure that our government is working for the people, not just the special interests. I will also continue to work towards a more equitable and just society, where everyone has access to quality healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.

We must also work towards reducing our deficit and promoting economic growth, while ensuring that our government is working for the people, not just the special interests.

I agree that we should prioritize passing comprehensive appropriations bills that address the long-term needs of our country. I also appreciate their commitment to ensuring that our federal agencies are adequately funded to provide essential services to the American people.

To my colleagues, I say that we must work together to find a solution that addresses the long-term needs of our nation and its people. We must prioritize passing comprehensive appropriations bills that provide stable and predictable funding for our federal agencies and programs. We must also work towards reducing our deficit and promoting economic growth, while ensuring that our government is working for the people, not just the special interests.

In particular, I would like to respond to Senator Hassan's comments. While I understand her concerns about the temporary nature of this solution, I believe that we must take a pragmatic approach to prevent a government shutdown and ensure the continued operation of essential programs and services.

John W. Hickenlooper: As I consider the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024, I must weigh the importance of preventing a government shutdown against the need for more comprehensive and responsible funding decisions. As a senator from Colorado and a strong advocate for the well-being of my constituents, I am particularly interested in the provisions that affect our nation's healthcare, education, and social services programs.

While I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to include extensions of critical programs, such as the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program and the Community Health Center Fund, I am concerned about the temporary nature of this solution. Continuing resolutions are not a substitute for responsible and comprehensive funding decisions. We should prioritize passing comprehensive appropriations bills that address the long-term needs of our country, rather than relying on short-term continuing resolutions.

I strongly disagree with the amendment proposed by Senator Paul, which aimed to reduce continuing funding by 15 percent and rescind $30 billion from enforcement funds provided to the Internal Revenue Service. Such drastic cuts would have severe consequences for many critical programs and services, including those that support our nation's most vulnerable populations.

However, I also believe that we must be mindful of our nation's fiscal situation and work towards reducing our deficit and promoting economic growth. I agree with my colleagues, including Senators Collins, Coons, and Cortez Masto, that we must work towards a more permanent and sustainable solution to our nation's funding needs.

John Kennedy: Folks, I'm a fiscal conservative, and I don't like continuing resolutions. They're like a bad habit - we keep doing 'em, and they're not good for the country. But I'm also a pragmatist, and I know that if we don't pass this bill, the government's gonna shut down. And that's not good for anybody.

Now, I've heard my colleagues, Ron Johnson, Tim Kaine, and Mark Kelly, talk about the importance of passing comprehensive appropriations bills. And I agree with 'em. We should be doing that. We should be making responsible, long-term funding decisions, not just kicking the can down the road with continuing resolutions.

But this bill, it's not all bad. It's got some good stuff in it, like extensions for the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program. Those are important programs, and they deserve our support.

And let me tell you, I'm glad that amendment proposed by Senator Paul didn't pass. That would've been a disaster. Cutting funding by 15 percent and rescinding $30 billion from the IRS? That's just not responsible.

So, I'm gonna vote yes on this bill. It's not perfect, but it's better than a government shutdown. And I'll keep working with my colleagues to try to find a more comprehensive, more responsible solution to our nation's funding needs.

To my colleagues, I say, let's work together to get this done. Let's prioritize passing comprehensive appropriations bills that provide stable and predictable funding for our federal agencies and programs. Let's reduce our deficit and promote economic growth, while ensuring that our government is working for the people, not just the special interests.

And to the American people, I say, I know this isn't the best solution, but it's a necessary one. We'll keep working to do better, to make sure that our government is funded in a responsible, sustainable way. That's what we owe to the people who sent us here to represent 'em.

Jeff Merkley: As I consider the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024, I must weigh the importance of preventing a government shutdown against the need for more comprehensive and responsible funding decisions.

While I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to include extensions of critical programs, such as the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program, I am concerned about the temporary nature of this solution. We should prioritize passing comprehensive appropriations bills that address the long-term needs of our country, rather than relying on short-term continuing resolutions.

I strongly disagree with the amendment proposed by Senator Paul, which aimed to reduce continuing funding by 15 percent and rescind $30 billion from enforcement funds provided to the Internal Revenue Service. Such drastic cuts would have severe consequences for many critical programs and services, including those that support our nation's most vulnerable populations.

As a senator who has been involved in environmental and agricultural issues, I am particularly concerned about the impact of this bill on our nation's rural communities and natural resources.

Rand Paul: The bill before us today is a classic example of Washington's kick-the-can-down-the-road approach to governance. Rather than making the tough decisions and passing a comprehensive appropriations bill, we're being asked to vote on a continuing resolution that simply extends current funding levels for a few more months.

As a senator who has consistently advocated for fiscal responsibility and limited government, I must express my strong opposition to this bill. The fact that it includes a plethora of extensions for various programs and authorities, without any meaningful reforms or reductions in spending, is a clear indication that Congress is not serious about addressing our nation's fiscal challenges.

I proposed an amendment to reduce continuing funding by 15 percent and rescind $30 billion from enforcement funds provided to the Internal Revenue Service. Unfortunately, my colleagues rejected this common-sense proposal, opting instead to continue down the path of unchecked spending and fiscal irresponsibility.

I understand that some of my colleagues may argue that this bill is necessary to prevent a government shutdown, but I would counter that this is a false choice. We should be working towards a comprehensive appropriations bill that prioritizes the needs of the American people, rather than simply extending the status quo.

Furthermore, I take issue with the fact that this bill includes funding for a multitude of programs that are not properly authorized or have not been subject to adequate oversight. This is a clear example of the kind of wasteful spending that has become all too common in Washington.

In conclusion, I will be voting no on this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this flawed legislation and instead work towards a more comprehensive and responsible solution to our nation's funding needs.

To my colleagues who have spoken in favor of this bill, I would say that while I understand the desire to prevent a government shutdown, we must not sacrifice our fiscal principles and responsibilities as lawmakers. We owe it to the American people to do better than this.

To Senators Murray, Ossoff, and Padilla, I would say that while I appreciate your concerns about the temporary nature of this solution, I believe that we must take a stronger stance against the kind of fiscal irresponsibility that this bill represents. We should be working towards a comprehensive appropriations bill that prioritizes the needs of the American people, rather than simply extending the status quo.

I will be voting Nay on this bill.

I am pleased to see that the bill extends several key programs authorized by the 2018 farm bill, including the Dairy Margin Coverage program and the Price Loss Coverage program. These programs are crucial for supporting our nation's dairy farmers and other agricultural producers.

I also appreciate the inclusion of funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program, the Community Health Center Fund, and the National Health Services Corps. These programs are essential for providing healthcare services to underserved communities and promoting health equity.

In response to my colleagues, I agree that we should prioritize passing comprehensive appropriations bills that address the long-term needs of our country. I also appreciate their commitment to ensuring that our federal agencies are adequately funded to provide essential services to the American people.

To Senator Paul, I would say that while I understand his concerns about fiscal responsibility, I believe that this bill is a necessary step to prevent a government shutdown and ensure the continued operation of essential programs and services. However, I also agree that we must work towards a more comprehensive and responsible solution to our nation's funding needs.

In conclusion, I will vote yes on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We must take a pragmatic approach to prevent a government shutdown and ensure the continued operation of essential programs and services. However, we must also continue to work towards a more comprehensive and responsible solution to our nation's funding needs.

I will be voting Yea on this bill.

Ron Wyden: I will be voting Yea on this bill. As a senator from Oregon and a strong advocate for progressive values, I believe that continuing resolutions are not a substitute for thorough and thoughtful appropriations bills. However, I also recognize the importance of preventing a government shutdown and ensuring the continued operation of essential programs and services.

I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to include extensions of critical programs, such as the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program.

As a senator who has been involved in efforts to promote tax fairness and reduce income inequality, I am particularly concerned about the impact of this bill on our nation's most vulnerable populations.

Todd Young: As I consider the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024, I must weigh the importance of preventing a government shutdown against the need for more comprehensive and responsible funding decisions. As a senator from Indiana and a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility, I believe that continuing resolutions are not a substitute for thorough and thoughtful appropriations bills.

However, I also recognize the importance of preventing a government shutdown and ensuring the continued operation of essential programs and services. The bill before us today provides continuing FY2024 appropriations for federal agencies and extends several expiring programs and authorities, including programs authorized by the 2018 farm bill and several public health programs.
