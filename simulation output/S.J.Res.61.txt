Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today seeks to disapprove a rule submitted by the Federal Highway Administration, which aims to assess the performance of the National Highway System, including a measure on greenhouse gas emissions. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always been committed to protecting our environment and promoting sustainable practices.

After careful consideration, I must express my strong opposition to this joint resolution. The rule in question is a crucial step towards reducing our nation's carbon footprint and mitigating the impacts of climate change. By assessing greenhouse gas emissions from our transportation sector, we can identify areas for improvement and work towards a more sustainable future.

Disapproving this rule would be a significant setback for our efforts to address climate change. It would undermine the progress we've made in promoting clean energy and reducing emissions. Furthermore, it would also undermine the authority of the Federal Highway Administration to regulate and oversee our nation's transportation infrastructure.

I understand that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule. However, I believe that the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable transportation practices far outweigh any potential costs.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have worked tirelessly to promote environmental protection and conservation. I have also worked to support the development of clean energy technologies and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

In light of this, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future for our nation.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: don't we have a responsibility to protect our planet and ensure a livable future for generations to come? Don't we owe it to our constituents to take bold action on climate change and promote sustainable practices?

I will not be swayed by partisan politics or special interests. I will stand strong in my commitment to environmental protection and sustainability. I urge my colleagues to do the same and vote against this resolution.

John Barrasso: The joint resolution before us today is a crucial step in reining in the overreach of the Federal Highway Administration. As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of excessive regulations on our economy and our way of life. The rule in question, which aims to assess greenhouse gas emissions from our transportation sector, is a perfect example of this overreach.

While I agree that we must take steps to reduce our nation's carbon footprint, I strongly believe that this rule is not the right approach. It would impose significant burdens on our state's economy, particularly on our energy and transportation industries, which are already struggling to recover from the pandemic.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this rule would undermine the authority of our state to manage its own transportation infrastructure. As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have worked tirelessly to promote environmental protection and conservation, but I also believe that we must do so in a way that respects the rights of our states and the interests of our constituents.

In response to my colleague, Senator Baldwin, I would say that while I share her commitment to environmental protection, I disagree with her assessment of this rule. I do not believe that it is a necessary or effective step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and I am concerned that it would have significant unintended consequences for our economy and our energy security.

As for her question about our responsibility to protect the planet, I would say that I am committed to doing so, but I also believe that we must do so in a way that is responsible, effective, and respectful of the rights of our states and the interests of our constituents. We must not allow partisan politics or special interests to drive our decision-making, but rather we must work together to find common-sense solutions that balance our environmental and economic goals.

In light of this, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule and instead work towards a more balanced and effective approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable transportation practices.

In fact, investing in clean energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth in our communities.

I appreciate the comments from my colleagues, Senator Baldwin and Senator Barrasso. While I understand Senator Barrasso's concerns about the potential impact on Wyoming's economy, I must respectfully disagree with his assessment of this rule. I believe that it is a necessary and effective step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable transportation practices.

To Senator Barrasso's point about respecting the rights of our states, I would say that I agree that we must work to find solutions that balance our environmental and economic goals. However, I do not believe that disapproving this rule is the right approach. Instead, we should be working together to find common-sense solutions that promote sustainable transportation practices and reduce our nation's carbon footprint.

In light of this, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future for our nation.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this rule would undermine the authority of our state to manage its own transportation infrastructure. As a member of the Senate, I have worked tirelessly to promote fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention, and I believe that this rule is a clear example of federal overreach.

I appreciate the comments from my colleagues, Senator Baldwin, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Bennet. However, I must respectfully disagree with their assessments of this rule. I believe that disapproving this rule is a necessary step in promoting a more balanced and effective approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable transportation practices.

I understand that some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule on their states' economies. However, I believe that we must take a long-term view and consider the devastating economic impacts of climate change if we fail to act. Investing in clean energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth in our communities.

I strongly disagree with the comments made by Senators Moran, Mullin, and Murkowski, who have expressed opposition to this rule. While I understand their concerns about potential economic impacts, I believe that they are taking a short-sighted view. The costs of climate change far outweigh any potential costs associated with reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Murphy, Murray, Ossoff, and Padilla, believe that this rule is necessary to address climate change. However, I strongly disagree. While I acknowledge the importance of protecting our environment, I believe that this rule would have unintended consequences on our economy, particularly on our energy and transportation industries.

I also believe that this rule would be a prime example of the federal government picking winners and losers. By assessing greenhouse gas emissions from our transportation sector, the federal government would be essentially dictating how our states should manage their own transportation systems. This is not only an overreach of federal authority, but it would also stifle innovation and competition in the private sector.

As a libertarian, I believe in limited government intervention in the economy. I believe that the free market, not the federal government, is best equipped to address the challenges of climate change.

Charles E. Schumer: As the Majority Leader of the Senate, I have carefully considered the joint resolution before us today, and I must say that I strongly disagree with the views expressed by my Republican colleagues, including Senators Rounds, Rubio, and Schmitt. Their claims of bureaucratic overreach and concerns about economic impacts are nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and other polluters.

I agree with my Democratic colleagues, including Senators Rosen, Sanders, and Schatz, who have emphasized the importance of addressing climate change and promoting sustainable practices. The rule submitted by the Federal Highway Administration is a necessary step towards reducing our nation's greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable transportation practices. It is not an example of federal government overreach, but rather a responsible use of authority to protect the public interest.

As a senator from New York, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of climate change, from rising sea levels to more frequent extreme weather events. It is our responsibility to take action to reduce our nation's carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices. Investing in clean energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth in our communities.

I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution. I believe that disapproving this rule would be a step backwards in our efforts to address climate change, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead working towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future for our nation. We owe it to our constituents, our children, and future generations to take bold action on climate change, and I will not support any efforts to undermine that goal.

I would like to commend Senators Rosen, Sanders, and Schatz for their thoughtful comments on this issue. They are absolutely right that we must take a long-term view and consider the devastating economic impacts of climate change if we fail to act. Let us work together to address the critical issue of climate change and promote a more sustainable future for our nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this joint resolution and instead supporting the important work of the Federal Highway Administration to reduce our nation's carbon footprint and promote sustainable transportation practices.

Rick Scott: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of my commitment to reducing the federal government's footprint and promoting a more balanced approach to addressing climate change. The rule submitted by the Federal Highway Administration, which aims to assess greenhouse gas emissions from our transportation sector, is a clear example of bureaucratic overreach.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Ricketts, Risch, Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule on our states and our nation as a whole. As a senator from Florida, I have to consider the potential impacts of this rule on my state's economy, and I believe it would be devastating. Our state is heavily reliant on tourism and transportation, and this rule would only serve to increase costs and burdens on our businesses and citizens.

I also believe that this rule would be a prime example of the federal government picking winners and losers. By assessing greenhouse gas emissions from our transportation sector, the federal government would be essentially dictating how our states should manage their own transportation systems. This is not only an overreach of federal authority, but it would also stifle innovation and competition in the private sector.

As a conservative, I believe in limited government intervention in the economy. I believe that the free market, not the federal government, is best equipped to address the challenges of climate change. By allowing the market to innovate and adapt, we can create new technologies and industries that would help reduce our carbon footprint without sacrificing economic growth.

Therefore, I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution. I believe that disapproving this rule is a necessary step in promoting a more balanced and effective approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable transportation practices. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule and instead work towards a more nuanced and effective approach to addressing climate change.

I must say, I am disappointed but not surprised by the comments from Senators Rosen, Sanders, and Schatz, who seem to be more concerned with advancing a radical environmental agenda than with considering the real-world impacts of this rule on our economy and our citizens. I hope that my colleagues will join me in taking a more thoughtful and balanced approach to addressing climate change, rather than simply trying to impose a one-size-fits-all solution from Washington.

I also believe that this rule would be a prime example of the federal government picking winners and losers.

While I understand the concerns expressed by my Republican colleagues, including Senators Ricketts, Risch, Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, about the potential economic impacts of this rule on their states and our nation as a whole, I also believe that we must take action to reduce our nation's carbon footprint and promote sustainable transportation practices.

As a senator from Arizona, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of climate change, from droughts to extreme weather events. It is our responsibility to take action to reduce our nation's carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices. Investing in clean energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth in our communities.

However, I also believe that we must be mindful of the potential economic impacts of this rule on our states and our nation as a whole.

I have been a strong advocate for climate action throughout my career, and I believe that this rule is a crucial step in the right direction. As a senator from Rhode Island, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of climate change, from rising sea levels to more frequent extreme weather events. It is our responsibility to take action to reduce our nation's carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices.

I strongly disagree with my Republican colleagues who claim that this rule is an example of bureaucratic overreach and would have devastating economic impacts on their states. In fact, I believe that investing in clean energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth in our communities. We must take a long-term view and consider the devastating economic impacts of climate change if we fail to act.

As a senator from Mississippi, I have to consider the potential impacts of this rule on my state's economy, and I believe it would be devastating. Our state is heavily reliant on transportation, and this rule would only serve to increase costs and burdens on our businesses and citizens.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Ricketts, Risch, Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule on their states and our nation as a whole. I also believe that this rule would be a prime example of the federal government picking winners and losers. By assessing greenhouse gas emissions from our transportation sector, the federal government would be essentially dictating how our states should manage their own transportation systems. This is not only an overreach of federal authority, but it would also stifle innovation and competition in the private sector.

As a conservative, I believe in limited government intervention in the economy. I believe that the free market, not the federal government, is best equipped to address the challenges of climate change. By allowing the market to innovate and adapt, we can create new technologies and industries that would help reduce our carbon footprint without sacrificing economic growth.

I must say, I am disappointed but not surprised by the comments from some of my Democratic colleagues, who seem to be more concerned with advancing a radical environmental agenda than with considering the real-world impacts of this rule on our economy and our citizens.

Therefore, I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution. I believe that disapproving this rule is a necessary step in promoting a more balanced and effective approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable transportation practices. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule and instead work towards a more nuanced and effective approach to addressing climate change.

While I understand the importance of addressing climate change, I believe that we must do so in a way that promotes economic growth and competitiveness, rather than undermining it. The transportation sector is a significant contributor to our nation's economy, and we must be mindful of the potential impacts of this rule on our economic interests.

I agree with my Republican colleagues, including Senators Cramer and Hawley, who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule. I also appreciate the concerns raised by Senators Hassan, Heinrich, and Hickenlooper, who emphasize the importance of addressing climate change. However, I believe that we must take a more nuanced approach to addressing climate change, one that balances our environmental goals with the need to promote economic growth and competitiveness.

The Federal Highway Administration's rule is an example of the kind of bureaucratic overreach that can stifle economic growth and impose unnecessary burdens on American workers and businesses. We must consider the potential costs and burdens that this rule could impose on our economy and work towards solutions that balance our environmental and economic goals.

Therefore, I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule and instead work towards a more effective and sustainable approach to addressing climate change. We owe it to our constituents, our children, and future generations to take bold action on climate change, but we must do so in a way that promotes economic growth and competitiveness, rather than undermining it.

In response to my Democratic colleagues, I say that we must consider the potential economic impacts of this rule and work towards solutions that balance our environmental and economic goals.
