Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 109, seeks to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. This bulletin provides crucial accounting and disclosure guidance for entities related to their obligations to safeguard cryptoassets held for users of their platforms.

As a senator who has consistently advocated for consumer protection and transparency in financial markets, I must express my strong opposition to this resolution. The SEC's rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies handling cryptoassets are held to the same standards of accountability and transparency as those in traditional financial markets.

By nullifying this rule, we would be undermining the efforts of the SEC to provide clarity and guidance to companies operating in the crypto space. This would not only create uncertainty and confusion but also potentially put consumers at risk of losing their investments due to lack of proper safeguards.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this resolution is part of a broader effort to undermine the regulatory authority of the SEC and other financial regulatory agencies. As a senator, it is my duty to protect the interests of consumers and investors, and I will not support any measure that would compromise their safety and well-being.

Therefore, I will be voting against H.J. Res. 109. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this resolution and instead work towards strengthening our financial regulatory framework to ensure that all market participants are held to the highest standards of transparency, accountability, and consumer protection.

I would like to ask the sponsor of this resolution, Representative Mike Flood, to explain why he believes that nullifying this rule is in the best interest of consumers and investors. What evidence does he have that this rule is causing harm to the crypto industry, and how does he propose to ensure that companies handling cryptoassets are held accountable for their actions?

John Barrasso: As a senator who has consistently advocated for reducing regulatory burdens and promoting economic growth, I strongly support H.J. Res. 109. The SEC's rule, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, is an overreach of the agency's authority and imposes unnecessary costs and complexities on companies operating in the crypto space.

The crypto industry is a rapidly evolving and innovative sector that requires a flexible and adaptable regulatory framework. The SEC's rule, however, would stifle innovation and hinder the growth of this industry. By nullifying this rule, we can ensure that companies handling cryptoassets are not unduly burdened by excessive regulations and can continue to innovate and provide services to their customers.

I disagree with my colleague, Senator Baldwin, who claims that this rule is necessary for consumer protection. In reality, this rule would only serve to drive companies out of the United States and into jurisdictions with more favorable regulatory environments. This would ultimately harm consumers by reducing their access to innovative financial products and services.

I would like to address Senator Baldwin's concerns about consumer protection. The crypto industry is already subject to a range of regulations and guidelines that protect consumers. The SEC's rule, however, would only add to the complexity and cost of compliance, without providing any meaningful benefits to consumers.

I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 109 and reject the SEC's overreaching rule. By doing so, we can promote innovation, reduce regulatory burdens, and ensure that the United States remains a leader in the global crypto industry.

In response to Senator Baldwin's question to Representative Mike Flood, I would say that the evidence is clear: the SEC's rule is causing harm to the crypto industry by driving up costs and complexity. The rule is also unclear and ambiguous, which would lead to confusion and uncertainty for companies operating in this space. By nullifying this rule, we can ensure that companies handling cryptoassets are free to innovate and provide services to their customers without being unduly burdened by excessive regulations.

I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 109, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

Michael F. Bennet: The joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 109, seeks to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. As a senator who has consistently advocated for pragmatic and balanced approaches to regulation, I must consider the implications of this resolution carefully.

While I understand the concerns of my colleague, Senator Baldwin, regarding consumer protection and transparency in financial markets, I also appreciate the points made by Senator Barrasso about the potential for overregulation and the need for a flexible regulatory framework that allows for innovation in the crypto space.

As I weigh the arguments, I am reminded of my own experiences as a former superintendent of Denver Public Schools, where I had to navigate complex regulatory environments to achieve our goals. I believe that regulation should be thoughtful, targeted, and effective in achieving its intended purposes.

In this case, I am not convinced that nullifying the SEC's rule is the right approach. The rule provides important guidance for entities handling cryptoassets, and its nullification could create uncertainty and confusion in the market. At the same time, I am open to exploring ways to improve the rule and make it more effective in achieving its goals.

I would like to ask Senator Barrasso and Senator Baldwin to consider a potential compromise. Rather than nullifying the rule outright, could we work together to identify areas where the rule could be improved or clarified to address the concerns of the crypto industry while still maintaining strong consumer protections?

I will be voting against H.J. Res. 109, but I am willing to engage in further discussion and exploration of alternative approaches that can balance the need for regulation with the need for innovation and flexibility in the crypto space.

Marsha Blackburn: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 109, I must say that I strongly support the effort to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121.

The crypto industry is already subject to a range of regulations and guidelines that protect consumers. The SEC's rule, however, would only add to the complexity and cost of compliance, without providing any meaningful benefits to consumers.

I understand that Senator Baldwin has expressed concerns about consumer protection, but I believe that these concerns can be addressed through other means. The crypto industry is already subject to a range of regulations and guidelines that protect consumers, and we should focus on strengthening these existing regulations rather than imposing new and burdensome rules.

I appreciate Senator Bennet's suggestion to consider a potential compromise, but I believe that nullifying the rule is the best approach. The rule is unclear and ambiguous, and its nullification would provide clarity and certainty for companies operating in the crypto space.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 109. I believe that this resolution is a necessary step towards promoting innovation and reducing regulatory burdens in the crypto industry. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and rejecting the SEC's overreaching rule.

As a senator who has consistently advocated for the needs of Black Americans, I am particularly concerned about the potential impact of this resolution on communities of color, who are already disproportionately affected by lack of access to financial services and opportunities. We must ensure that our regulatory framework is fair, equitable, and inclusive, and that it promotes economic opportunity and mobility for all Americans, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.

I will be voting against H.J. Res. 109, and I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this resolution and instead working towards a more balanced and effective approach to regulating the crypto industry.

Res. 109, I must say that I strongly oppose the effort to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. As a senator who has consistently advocated for consumer protection and transparency in financial markets, I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies handling cryptoassets are held to the same standards of accountability and transparency as those in traditional financial markets.

The SEC's rule provides crucial accounting and disclosure guidance for entities related to their obligations to safeguard cryptoassets held for users of their platforms. By nullifying this rule, we would be undermining the efforts of the SEC to provide clarity and guidance to companies operating in the crypto space. This would not only create uncertainty and confusion but also potentially put consumers at risk of losing their investments due to lack of proper safeguards.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Baldwin, Blumenthal, and Booker, that the crypto industry is a rapidly evolving sector that requires effective regulation to protect consumers and promote transparency. While I understand the concerns about overregulation and the need for innovation, I believe that these concerns can be addressed through targeted and effective regulation, rather than by nullifying the SEC's rule outright.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on their states' economies, I would say that the benefits of effective regulation far outweigh the potential costs. By providing clarity and guidance to companies operating in the crypto space, we can promote innovation and growth while also protecting consumers and maintaining the integrity of our financial markets.

I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this resolution and instead work towards finding a balanced and effective approach to regulating the crypto industry. We must prioritize consumer protection and transparency, while also allowing for innovation and growth in this rapidly evolving sector. I will be voting against H.J. Res. 109, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in standing up for the interests of consumers and the integrity of our financial markets.

In particular, I would like to address the comments made by Senators Boozman, Braun, and Britt, who have argued that the SEC's rule is an overreach of the agency's authority and would stifle innovation in the crypto industry. While I understand their concerns, I believe that the SEC's rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies handling cryptoassets are held to the same standards of accountability and transparency as those in traditional financial markets.

I would also like to respond to Senator Budd's comment that the crypto industry is already subject to a range of regulations and guidelines that protect consumers. While this is true, I believe that the SEC's rule provides crucial additional guidance and clarity for companies operating in the crypto space, and that nullifying this rule would create uncertainty and confusion for both companies and consumers.

As a senator from Maryland, I am particularly concerned about the potential impact of this rule on our state's economy. Maryland is home to a growing number of companies that operate in the crypto space, and I believe that effective regulation is necessary to promote innovation and growth while also protecting consumers.

To my colleagues who have expressed support for this resolution, I would say that I understand the desire to promote innovation and reduce regulatory burdens, but I believe that this resolution is not the right approach. Instead, I propose that we work together to find a balanced and effective approach to regulating the crypto industry, one that prioritizes consumer protection and transparency while also allowing for innovation and growth.

In conclusion, I will be voting against H.J. Res. 109, and I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this resolution and instead working towards finding a balanced and effective approach to regulating the crypto industry. We must prioritize consumer protection and transparency, while also allowing for innovation and growth in this rapidly evolving sector.

Tammy Duckworth: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 109, I must say that I strongly oppose the effort to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. As a senator who has consistently advocated for protecting consumers and maintaining the integrity of our financial markets, I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies operating in the crypto space are transparent and accountable to their users.

I understand the concerns expressed by my colleagues, Senators Cotton, Cramer, Crapo, Cruz, and Daines, regarding the potential impact of this rule on the crypto industry. However, I believe that these concerns are overstated and that the benefits of this rule far outweigh the potential costs. The crypto industry is a rapidly evolving and innovative sector, but it is also a sector that is prone to volatility and instability. As such, it is imperative that we have robust regulations in place to protect consumers and maintain the integrity of our financial markets.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Coons and Cortez Masto, that consumer protection and transparency in financial markets are essential. The SEC's rule is a step in the right direction, as it provides guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements for companies that hold cryptoassets for their users. This rule will help to ensure that companies are transparent about their holdings and that consumers are protected from potential risks.

I will be voting against H.J. Res. 109. I believe that this resolution is a misguided attempt to undermine the SEC's authority and to stifle innovation in the crypto industry. Instead of nullifying this rule, we should be working to strengthen our regulatory framework and to provide clarity and certainty for companies operating in the crypto space.

I believe that this resolution is a step in the wrong direction and that it would undermine the SEC's authority and the integrity of our financial markets. Instead, we should be working to strengthen our regulatory framework and to provide clarity and certainty for companies operating in the crypto space.

Cindy Hyde-Smith: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 109, I must say that I strongly support the effort to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121.

John Kennedy: The crypto space.  Now, I'm all for innovation, and I think it's great that we've got companies out there pushing the boundaries of what's possible with cryptocurrency.  But let's be real, folks.  The SEC's rule, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, is a necessary step towards ensuring that these companies are transparent and accountable to their users.

Now, I know some of my colleagues, like Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, are concerned that this rule is going to stifle innovation and drive companies out of the country.  But I think that's a bit of an exaggeration.  The SEC's rule is a reasonable attempt to provide guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements for companies that hold cryptoassets for their users.

And let's not forget, consumer protection is essential here.  We've got to make sure that people who are investing in cryptocurrency are protected from potential risks.  The SEC's rule helps to ensure that companies are transparent about their holdings, and that's a good thing.

Now, I'm not saying that the SEC's rule is perfect.  But I think it's a step in the right direction.  And I'm concerned that if we nullify this rule, we're going to be sending a signal that we're not serious about protecting consumers and maintaining the integrity of our financial markets.

So, I'll be voting no on H.J. Res. 109.  I think we should be working to strengthen our regulatory framework, not undermine the SEC's authority.  And I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of their actions and to prioritize the protection of consumers and the integrity of our financial markets.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I'd say that I understand your concerns about regulatory burdens, but I think we can address those concerns through targeted and effective regulation, rather than by nullifying the SEC's rule outright.

As a senator from North Dakota, I have given this issue careful consideration, and I must say that I am inclined to support the effort to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121.

While I understand the concerns expressed by Senators Casey, Coons, and others about the importance of consumer protection and transparency in financial markets, I believe that the SEC's rule may be an overreach of the agency's authority and could potentially stifle growth in the crypto industry. I agree with Senators Cassidy, Collins, and Cornyn that we must balance our desire to protect consumers with the need to promote innovation and growth in the crypto industry.

As a long-time advocate for reducing regulatory burdens and promoting economic growth, I believe that this rule may be overly broad and burdensome. The crypto industry is a rapidly evolving field, and I believe that we should be cautious about imposing regulations that could drive companies out of the country and harm the industry. Instead, we should be working to create a regulatory framework that promotes transparency, accountability, and innovation in the crypto industry.

I appreciate the comments made by my colleagues who share my concerns about the potential impact of this rule on the crypto industry. I also appreciate the comments made by those who disagree with me, and I hope that we can work together to find a solution that balances these competing interests.

In the end, I believe that we must prioritize the promotion of innovation and growth in the crypto industry, while also ensuring that consumers are protected and our financial markets are maintained. I will be voting yes on H.J. Res. 109, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of their actions and to prioritize the needs of the crypto industry.

I will now cast my vote in favor of the resolution.

Mike Crapo: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, H.J. Res. 109, I must say that I strongly support the effort to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Coons, Cortez Masto, and Casey, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on consumer protection and the integrity of our financial markets.

I agree with Senators Cotton, Cornyn, and Cramer that we must prioritize the promotion of innovation and growth in the crypto industry, while also ensuring that consumers are protected and our financial markets are maintained. I believe that this rule may drive companies out of the country and harm the industry, rather than promoting confidence and transparency.

In particular, I would like to address the comments made by Senator Coons, who stated that the SEC's rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies operating in the crypto space are transparent and accountable to their users. I respectfully disagree with this assessment, and I believe that the SEC's rule is an overreach of the agency's authority.

I would also like to address the comments made by Senator Cortez Masto, who stated that the SEC's rule will actually help to promote confidence in the crypto industry by providing clear guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements. I believe that this concern is overstated, and I think that the SEC's rule will actually drive companies out of the country and harm the crypto industry.

In the end, I believe that we must prioritize the promotion of innovation and growth in the crypto industry, while also ensuring that consumers are protected and our financial markets are maintained. I will be voting yes on H.J. Res. 109, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of their actions and to prioritize the needs of the crypto industry.

Res. 109, I must say that I strongly oppose the effort to nullify the rule issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2022, titled Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. As a senator from California, I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies operating in the crypto space are transparent and accountable to their users.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Kaine, Kelly, Klobuchar, King, Markey, Murray, and Ossoff, that we have a responsibility to protect consumers and maintain the integrity of our financial markets. The crypto industry is a rapidly evolving field, and I believe that we should be working to create a regulatory framework that promotes transparency, accountability, and innovation in the crypto industry.

The SEC's rule provides guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements for companies that hold cryptoassets for their users, and I believe that it is a reasonable and necessary step towards achieving the goals of transparency and accountability in the crypto industry. I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, Kennedy, Lankford, and Lee, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on the crypto industry.

As a senator from New Jersey, I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies operating in the crypto space are transparent and accountable to their users.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Tillis, Tuberville, and Vance, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on the crypto industry. However, I believe that these concerns are overstated. The SEC's rule provides guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements for companies that hold cryptoassets for their users, and I believe that it is a necessary step towards protecting consumers and maintaining the integrity of our financial markets.

I appreciate the comments made by Senators Van Hollen, Ossoff, Padilla, Warner, Warnock, Warren, Welch, Whitehouse, Wyden, Baldwin, and Bennet, who share my concerns about the importance of consumer protection and transparency in financial markets. I also appreciate the comments made by Senator Reed, who agrees that the SEC's rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies operating in the crypto space are transparent and accountable to their users.

As a long-time advocate for consumer protection and financial regulation, I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards promoting transparency and accountability in the crypto industry. I will be voting no on H.J. Res. 109, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of their actions and to prioritize the protection of consumers and the integrity of our financial markets.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I would say that I understand your desire to promote innovation and growth in the crypto industry, but I believe that we must balance this desire with the need to protect consumers and maintain the integrity of our financial markets. I hope that we can work together to find a solution that balances these competing interests.

In particular, I would like to address the comments made by Senator Barrasso, who stated that the SEC's rule is an overreach of the agency's authority and will stifle growth in the crypto industry. I respectfully disagree with this assessment, and I believe that the SEC's rule is a necessary step towards ensuring that companies operating in the crypto space are transparent and accountable to their users.

I would also like to address the comments made by Senator Blackburn, who stated that the SEC's rule will drive companies out of the country and harm the crypto industry. I believe that this concern is overstated, and I think that the SEC's rule will actually help to promote confidence in the crypto industry by providing clear guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements.

In the end, I believe that we must prioritize the protection of consumers and the integrity of our financial markets, while also promoting innovation and growth in the crypto industry. I will be voting no on H.J. Res. 109, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and to work towards finding a solution that balances the need to promote innovation and growth in the crypto industry with the need to protect consumers and maintain the integrity of our financial markets.

I will now cast my vote against the resolution.
