Tammy Baldwin: The continuing resolution before us today is a necessary step to prevent a government shutdown and ensure that our federal agencies and programs continue to operate. As a senator from Wisconsin, I am pleased to see that this bill provides funding for key programs that benefit my constituents, such as the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.

I also appreciate the revisions to the computation of the student aid index, which will help make federal student aid more accessible to dependent students. The provision that specifies a student's available income shall not be less than -$1,500 for award year 2024-2025 and not less than $0 for award year 2025-2026 and each succeeding award year is a step in the right direction. Additionally, the provision of additional funds for Federal Pell Grants for FY2025 and each succeeding fiscal year will help make higher education more affordable for Wisconsin students.

However, I do have some concerns about the overall funding levels and the fact that this is a short-term continuing resolution. I believe that we should be working towards a more comprehensive and long-term budget solution that addresses the needs of our country and provides stability for our federal agencies and programs.

Despite these concerns, I will be voting in favor of this continuing resolution. I believe that it is a necessary step to prevent a government shutdown and ensure that our federal agencies and programs continue to operate. I will continue to work with my colleagues to find a more comprehensive and long-term solution to our budget challenges.

As for the previous amendments and motions, I voted against the motions to commit to the Senate Committee on Appropriations with instructions, as I believe that they were unnecessary and would have delayed the passage of this critical legislation. I also voted against Amendment SA 1614, which would have established prohibitions relating to the purchase or sale of State or municipal securities, as I believe that it was not relevant to the underlying bill and would have caused unnecessary complications.

Overall, I am pleased that we are taking this step to prevent a government shutdown and ensure that our federal agencies and programs continue to operate. I will continue to work towards a more comprehensive and long-term budget solution that addresses the needs of our country and provides stability for our federal agencies and programs.

As a senator who has long advocated for a more comprehensive and long-term budget solution, I believe that we should be working towards a budget that addresses the needs of our country and provides stability for our federal agencies and programs.

Marsha Blackburn: I rise today to express my thoughts on the continuing resolution before us. As a senator from Tennessee, I have always been a strong advocate for fiscal conservatism and limited government spending. While I understand the importance of preventing a government shutdown, I have concerns about the overall funding levels and the fact that this is a short-term continuing resolution.

I will continue to work towards a more comprehensive and long-term budget solution that addresses the needs of our country and provides stability for our federal agencies and programs.

As a senator who has long advocated for the interests of my constituents, including those in the environmental and business communities, I am pleased to see that this bill provides funding for key programs that benefit my state, such as the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.

Regarding the previous amendments and motions, I voted against the motions to commit to the Senate Committee on Appropriations with instructions, as I believe that they were unnecessary and would have delayed the passage of this critical legislation. I also voted against Amendment SA 1614, which would have established prohibitions relating to the purchase or sale of State or municipal securities, as I believe that it was not relevant to the underlying bill and would have caused unnecessary complications.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure, and I look forward to continuing to work together to find a more sustainable and responsible approach to funding our government.

John Kennedy: The theatrics of Washington. My colleagues are singing the same old song, and I'm not buying the lyrics. This continuing resolution is a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. It's a temporary fix, a stopgap measure that doesn't address the underlying problems with our budget.

I've heard Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, Johnson, Kaine, and Kelly all say that this bill is necessary to prevent a government shutdown. And I agree, we can't let the government shut down. But that's exactly the problem - we're always talking about preventing a shutdown, rather than actually addressing our spending habits.

I'm a fiscal conservative, and I believe in reducing government spending. This bill doesn't do that. It just kicks the can down the road, funding most programs at the same levels as last year, with a few exceptions. And what's the point of those exceptions, anyway? Are we really making a meaningful difference, or are we just throwing money at problems without any real solutions?

And don't even get me started on the student aid index. I'm all for making higher education more affordable, but this provision is just a drop in the bucket. We need to be looking at the root causes of why college is so expensive in the first place, rather than just throwing more money at the problem.

I know my colleagues are trying to do the right thing, but I just can't bring myself to vote for this bill. It's a short-term fix that doesn't address the long-term problems. I'll be voting no on this continuing resolution, and I hope my colleagues will join me in demanding a better solution. We owe it to the American people to do better than this.

Angus S. King Jr.: The theatrics of Washington indeed. As I consider this continuing resolution, I'm reminded of the importance of responsible governance and the need to prioritize the well-being of the American people, particularly those in my home state of Maine.

As an independent senator, I've always tried to find common ground and work towards bipartisan solutions.

Mike Lee: As I consider this continuing resolution, I must say that I'm disappointed, but not surprised, by the lack of meaningful reforms and fiscal responsibility in this bill. While I understand the importance of preventing a government shutdown and ensuring the continued operation of our federal agencies and programs, I believe that we're just kicking the can down the road with this short-term fix.

I've listened to my colleagues, including Senators Kelly, King, Klobuchar, and Lankford, and I appreciate their thoughtful comments on this bill. However, I must respectfully disagree with their decision to support this continuing resolution. I share the concerns of Senator Kennedy about the overall funding levels and the fact that this is a short-term continuing resolution. We're not addressing the underlying problems with our budget, and we're not making any meaningful efforts to reduce government spending.

As a fiscal conservative, I believe that we need to take a more comprehensive and long-term approach to our budget challenges. We need to make tough decisions about our spending priorities and find ways to reduce our debt and deficits. This continuing resolution doesn't do that. It just funds most programs at the same levels as last year, with a few exceptions, and doesn't provide any meaningful reforms or reductions in government spending.

I'm also concerned about the revisions to the computation of the student aid index. While I appreciate the effort to make federal student aid more accessible to dependent students, I believe that we need to take a more comprehensive approach to addressing the rising costs of higher education. We need to look at the root causes of why college is so expensive and find ways to make it more affordable for all students, not just those who are dependent on their parents.

In light of these concerns, I will be voting no on this continuing resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in demanding a better solution, one that prioritizes fiscal responsibility, reduces government spending, and addresses the underlying problems with our budget. We owe it to the American people to do better than this.

I appreciate the revisions to the computation of the student aid index, which will help make federal student aid more accessible to dependent students. The provision that specifies a student's available income shall not be less than -$1,500 for award year 2024-2025 and not less than $0 for award year 2025-2026 and each succeeding award year is a step in the right direction. Additionally, the provision of additional funds for Federal Pell Grants for FY2025 and each succeeding fiscal year will help make higher education more affordable for students in South Dakota and across the country.

As a Republican and a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility, I have concerns about the overall funding levels and the fact that this is a short-term continuing resolution.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville from Alabama, and I'm here to share my thoughts on this continuing resolution. As a Republican and a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility, I've got some concerns about this bill. Now, I know we need to prevent a government shutdown, and I'm willing to support this continuing resolution as a necessary step. But I've got to say, I'm not thrilled about the overall funding levels and the fact that this is a short-term fix.

I appreciate the revisions to the computation of the student aid index, which will help make federal student aid more accessible to dependent students. And I'm glad to see the provision of additional funds for Federal Pell Grants for FY2025 and each succeeding fiscal year. That's a step in the right direction towards making higher education more affordable for students in Alabama and across the country.

But let's be real, folks. This continuing resolution is not a long-term solution to our budget challenges. We need to take a more comprehensive approach to our budget, and we need to do it soon. I'm willing to work with my colleagues to find a more comprehensive and long-term solution to our budget challenges, but we need to get serious about it.

And to my colleagues, I say let's get to work on a long-term budget solution that prioritizes fiscal responsibility, reduces our national debt, and promotes economic growth. We can do better than this, and we must do better. The American people are counting on us.

In conclusion, I believe that this continuing resolution is a necessary step to prevent a government shutdown and ensure the continued operation of our federal agencies and programs. I will vote yes on this bill and continue to work with my colleagues to find a more comprehensive and long-term solution to our budget challenges, one that prioritizes the well-being of the American people and reflects the values of responsible governance and investment in our nation's priorities.
