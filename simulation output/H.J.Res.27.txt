Tammy Baldwin: The bill before us today, H.J. Res. 27, seeks to nullify the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule, which was recently submitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have to consider the impact of this rule on our state's waterways, farmers, and environment.

While I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues about the scope of the Clean Water Act, I believe that the revised rule is a necessary step to protect our nation's water resources. The rule includes certain wetlands and ephemeral waters, which are essential to maintaining the health of our ecosystems and ensuring the quality of our drinking water.

As someone who has worked tirelessly to protect our environment and public health, I am troubled by the attempt to nullify this rule. The Clean Water Act has been a cornerstone of our environmental protection laws for decades, and weakening it would have far-reaching consequences for our communities and our planet.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this bill is an example of congressional overreach, as it seeks to undermine the authority of the executive branch to regulate and protect our environment. The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have worked diligently to develop a rule that balances the needs of various stakeholders, and I believe that we should respect their expertise and allow them to do their job.

Therefore, I will be voting against H.J. Res. 27. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and instead work towards finding solutions that protect our environment, public health, and the economy. We owe it to our constituents and future generations to act responsibly and ensure that our water resources are safeguarded for years to come.

John Barrasso: As I stand here today, I'm reminded of the importance of protecting our nation's water resources, but also of the need to balance that protection with the interests of our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. The revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule, submitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, is a prime example of government overreach.

As a senator from Wyoming, I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of overly broad regulations on our state's agriculture and energy industries. The 2023 rule, which includes certain wetlands and ephemeral waters, would only serve to further burden our farmers and ranchers with unnecessary and costly compliance measures.

I understand that my colleague, Senator Baldwin, has expressed concerns about the potential consequences of nullifying this rule. However, I believe that the concerns of our constituents, who would be directly affected by this rule, must take precedence. The Clean Water Act is a vital piece of legislation, but it must be applied in a way that respects the rights of property owners and the interests of our economy.

I'd like to address Senator Baldwin's point about congressional overreach. I believe that it's our duty as lawmakers to ensure that the executive branch is not abusing its authority. In this case, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have overstepped their bounds, and it's our responsibility to correct that.

I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 27, and I urge my colleagues to join me in nullifying this rule.

To Senator Baldwin, I respect your dedication to environmental protection, and I share your commitment to preserving our nation's natural resources. However, I believe that we must approach this issue with a more nuanced perspective, one that takes into account the complex needs of our economy and our constituents. I hope that we can work together to find common ground and develop solutions that benefit all Americans.

The revised rule is a balanced approach that takes into account the needs of various stakeholders, including farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. It includes certain wetlands and ephemeral waters, which are essential to maintaining the health of our ecosystems and ensuring the quality of our drinking water.

I also disagree with the argument that this bill is not an example of congressional overreach.

I agree that we must balance the needs of our economy with the need to protect our environment, and I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards achieving that balance.

This rule is a crucial step towards protecting our nation's water resources, and it is based on the best available science.

John Kennedy: Folks, let me tell you, I'm a fiscal conservative, and I believe in protecting our environment, but I also believe in doing it in a way that doesn't strangle our economy. This revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule, submitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, is a classic example of government overreach.

I've heard from my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, and I agree with them that this rule is an example of the federal government sticking its nose in where it doesn't belong. We've got to balance the needs of our economy with the need to protect our environment, and this rule just doesn't do that.

I'm not buying the argument that this rule is necessary to protect our water resources. We've got to be careful not to let the federal government run roughshod over the rights of property owners and the interests of our economy. I've seen it time and time again, where the federal government comes in and starts telling folks what they can and can't do with their own land, and it's just not right.

Now, I know some of my colleagues, like Senators Kaine and Kelly, are going to argue that this rule is necessary to protect our environment and public health. And I understand where they're coming from, but I just don't think this rule is the right way to do it.

So, I'm going to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 27, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Let's nullify this rule and start over with a clean slate. Let's work together to find a solution that protects our environment and our economy, without letting the federal government get too big for its britches.

And to my colleagues who are going to vote against this resolution, I say, let's not forget that we're here to represent the people, not the federal bureaucracy. We've got to stand up for the rights of property owners and the interests of our economy, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm voting "yes" on this resolution.

King Jr.: The debate on the joint resolution to nullify the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule has been quite lively, with my colleagues presenting various perspectives on the issue.

While I understand the concerns of Senators Hyde-Smith, Johnson, and Kennedy regarding the potential burdens this rule may impose on farmers, ranchers, and small businesses, I also recognize the importance of protecting our nation's water resources. The revised definition of "Waters of the United States" is a necessary update to the Clean Water Act, and it's based on the best available science.

As someone who's worked to promote environmental protection and conservation in Maine, I believe it's essential to strike a balance between economic development and environmental stewardship.

As a senator from Oklahoma, I have seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. This rule, in my opinion, is an example of government overreach and will have a devastating impact on our economy. The rule's broad definition of "waters of the United States" will lead to increased regulatory burdens, costly permitting requirements, and unnecessary delays in development projects.

I understand the concerns of my colleagues, such as Senators Markey, Menendez, and Merkley, who argue that this rule is necessary to protect our environment and public health. However, I believe that we must also consider the long-term benefits of promoting economic growth and job creation. We need to find a balance between protecting our environment and promoting economic growth, and I believe that this rule is not the right way to achieve that balance.

In my home state of Oklahoma, we have a strong tradition of responsible land use and environmental stewardship. However, this rule goes too far and will have a disproportionate impact on our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. I have heard from countless constituents who are concerned about the impact of this rule on their livelihoods and their ability to make a living.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 27. I believe that nullifying this rule is necessary to protect our economy and the rights of property owners. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and to support the repeal of the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the impact of this rule on our environment, I understand their concerns, but I believe that we must also consider the potential consequences of overregulation. I agree that we must balance the needs of our economy with the need to protect our environment, and I believe that this rule is not the right way to achieve that balance.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 27 and to support the repeal of the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule. This rule is a classic example of government overreach, and it will have a devastating impact on our economy. As a senator from Oklahoma, I am committed to protecting our economy and promoting job creation, and I believe that this rule is a step in the wrong direction. I will be voting "yes" on this resolution.

I understand the concerns of my colleagues, such as Senators Markey, Menendez, and Merkley, who argue that this rule is necessary to protect our environment and public health. I agree that we must protect our water resources, but I believe that this rule is not the right way to achieve that goal.

In Alaska, we have a unique relationship with our natural resources, and we must ensure that any regulations take into account the specific needs and challenges of our state. I have heard from many of my constituents who are concerned about the impact of this rule on their livelihoods and their ability to make a living.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 27 and to support the repeal of the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule.

I would like to address the comments made by my colleagues, Senators Lujan, Lummis, Manchin, Markey, and Marshall. While I understand their concerns, I strongly disagree with their conclusions. Senators Lummis and Manchin have argued that this rule is an example of government overreach, but I believe that it is a necessary exercise of federal authority to protect our nation's water resources.

Rand Paul: The revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule.  I've given this issue a lot of thought, and I have to say, I'm strongly opposed to this rule. As a senator from Kentucky, I've seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our farmers, our small businesses, and our communities. This rule is just another example of the federal government overstepping its bounds and imposing its will on our citizens.

I understand that some of my colleagues may think that this rule is necessary to protect our environment, but I disagree. I think it's a classic case of government overreach, and it will have serious consequences for our economy and our way of life. The rule is too broad, too vague, and it will give the federal government too much power to regulate our water resources.

I'm also concerned about the impact this rule will have on our property rights. As a nation, we've always believed in the importance of private property rights, and this rule undermines those rights. It will give the federal government the power to dictate how we use our own land, and that's just not right.

Now, I know that some of my colleagues may say that this rule is based on the best available science, but I'm not convinced. I think we need to take a closer look at the science behind this rule and make sure that it's not just a excuse for more government regulation.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of H.J. Res. 27, which would nullify this rule. I think it's a necessary step to protect our economy, our property rights, and our way of life. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule and supporting this resolution.

And to my colleagues who have spoken out against this resolution, I would say that I understand their concerns, but I respectfully disagree. I think we need to be careful about giving the federal government too much power, and we need to make sure that we're not undermining our property rights and our economic freedoms.

So, let's stand up for our citizens, let's stand up for our economy, and let's stand up for our way of life. Let's vote in favor of H.J. Res. 27 and nullify this rule. I will be voting "yes" on this resolution.

Marco Rubio: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of the importance of protecting our nation's water resources, while also being mindful of the potential impact on our economy and the rights of property owners. The revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule, submitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.

As a senator from Florida, I have seen firsthand the impact of pollution on our water resources. The Everglades, a vital part of our state's economy and ecosystem, has faced significant challenges in recent years. I believe that this rule is a necessary update to the Clean Water Act, and it will help to ensure that our water resources, including certain wetlands and ephemeral waters, are protected for future generations.

However, I also understand the concerns of my colleagues, such as Senators Rand Paul, Pete Ricketts, and James E. Risch, who argue that this rule is an example of government overreach. As a fiscal conservative, I am always wary of regulations that may stifle economic growth or infringe on individual freedoms.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 27, which would nullify this rule. While I believe that protecting our environment is crucial, I also think that this rule may be too broad and too vague, and it could have unintended consequences for our economy and our way of life.

I agree with my colleagues who argue that we need to take a closer look at the science behind this rule and make sure that it's not just an excuse for more government regulation. As a nation, we must balance the needs of our economy with the need to protect our environment, and I believe that this rule may tip the scales too far in favor of government overreach.

I will be voting "yes" on this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule and supporting this resolution. Let's stand up for our citizens, let's stand up for our economy, and let's stand up for our way of life. Let's vote in favor of H.J. Res. 27 and nullify this rule.

This rule, submitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, is a prime example of government overreach.

Roger F. Wicker: I'm Senator Roger Wicker from Mississippi, and I'm here to express my strong support for this joint resolution to nullify the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule. As a senator from a state with a rich agricultural heritage and a strong outdoor recreation industry, I've seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses.

This rule, which was submitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, is a prime example of federal overreach. It would give the federal government unprecedented authority to regulate waters and wetlands, including those on private property. This would not only be a significant burden on our farmers and ranchers but also undermine the rights of property owners.

I understand that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including Senators Warner, Warnock, Warren, Welch, and Whitehouse, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this resolution on our environment and public health. However, I respectfully disagree with their assessment. The Clean Water Act has been in place for decades, and it has been instrumental in protecting our water resources and public health. But this revised definition of "Waters of the United States" goes too far, and it's not based on sound science or law.

In fact, this rule would have a devastating impact on our economy, particularly in rural areas where access to clean water is already limited. It would stifle economic development, kill jobs, and undermine the very fabric of our communities. As a senator from Mississippi, I've seen the devastating impact of overregulation on our rural communities, and I will not stand idly by while this rule is allowed to take effect.

I'd like to respond to Senator Warner's comment that this rule is a necessary update to ensure that our water resources are protected from pollution and degradation. I understand his concerns, but I believe that this rule is not the right solution. Instead, we should be working to promote sustainable economic development that protects our environment, not undermining the laws that protect our water resources.

I'd also like to address Senator Warnock's comment that this rule is based on science and the law. I respectfully disagree. This rule is based on a flawed interpretation of the Clean Water Act, and it would give the federal government unprecedented authority to regulate waters and wetlands.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution to nullify the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule. Let's stand up for our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. Let's protect the rights of property owners and promote sustainable economic development that protects our environment. I will be voting "yes" on this resolution.

John Barrasso: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of the importance of protecting the interests of my constituents in Wyoming and the well-being of our great nation. After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of nullifying the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule.

As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. This rule, which was submitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, is a prime example of federal overreach. It would give the federal government unprecedented authority to regulate waters and wetlands, including those on private property, which would be a significant burden on our farmers and ranchers and undermine the rights of property owners.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Wicker and Young, that this rule is not based on sound science or law. Instead, we should be working to promote sustainable economic development that protects our environment, not undermining the laws that protect our water resources.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Whitehouse, Wyden, and Baldwin, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this resolution on our environment and public health.

Robert P. Casey Jr.: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of the importance of protecting our environment and preserving the integrity of the Clean Water Act.

The revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule is a significant expansion of federal authority that could harm our economy, particularly in states like North Carolina where agriculture and small businesses are vital to our economy.

As a senator from North Carolina, I have seen firsthand the importance of protecting our environment and our natural resources, but I also understand the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. I believe that the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule goes too far and could lead to unnecessary and costly regulations that would harm our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses.

I disagree with the comments made by Senators Jeanne Shaheen, Tina Smith, and others who argue that this rule is a necessary step to protect our nation's water resources and ensure that our communities have access to clean and safe drinking water. While I understand their concerns, I believe that their approach is misguided and that we should be working to find solutions that balance economic development with environmental protection, rather than relying on a broad and overly expansive definition of "Waters of the United States".

I would like to respond to Senator Kyrsten Sinema's comments by saying that I appreciate her call for a more nuanced approach to this issue. However, I believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step to prevent the harm that it could cause to our economy and our states' rights.

Therefore, I will be voting "yes" on this resolution to nullify the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for our economy, our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses, and our states' rights by rejecting this misguided attempt to undermine our nation's water protections. We must work together to find solutions that balance economic development with environmental protection, rather than pitting these interests against each other.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville from Alabama, and I'm here to give my thoughts on this joint resolution. As a Christian conservative, I believe in protecting our environment, but I also believe in protecting our economy and our states' rights. The revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule is a significant expansion of federal authority that could harm our economy, particularly in states like Alabama where agriculture and small businesses are vital to our economy.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Dan Sullivan, John Thune, and Thomas Tillis, who argue that this rule goes too far and could lead to unnecessary and costly regulations that would harm our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses. I also believe that we should be working to find solutions that balance economic development with environmental protection, rather than relying on a broad and overly expansive definition of "Waters of the United States".

I understand that some of my colleagues, like Senators Tina Smith and Debbie Stabenow, may have concerns about the potential impact of this rule on our environment and public health.

As a former football coach, I know that sometimes you have to make tough decisions to win the game. And in this case, I believe that nullifying this rule is the right call.

So, I will be voting "yes" on this resolution to nullify the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule.

Roger F. Wicker: I rise today to express my strong support for this joint resolution, which nullifies the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule. As a senator from Mississippi, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact that overregulation can have on our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses.

This rule, which was submitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, is a prime example of federal overreach. It would give the federal government unprecedented authority to regulate bodies of water, including small streams and wetlands, that are currently under the jurisdiction of the states.

I understand that some of my colleagues may believe that this rule is necessary to protect our nation's water resources, but I strongly disagree. This rule is a solution in search of a problem, and it would have a disproportionate impact on rural communities like those in my home state of Mississippi.

I would like to respond to my colleagues, including Senators Mark Warner, Raphael Warnock, Elizabeth Warren, Peter Welch, and Sheldon Whitehouse, who have spoken out in favor of this rule. While I understand their concerns about protecting our environment and public health, I believe that this rule is not the right approach.

We need to find solutions that balance economic development with environmental protection, rather than pitting these interests against each other. This rule would do just that, and it would have a devastating impact on our economy.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and nullifying this misguided rule. We owe it to our constituents, our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses to stand up against federal overreach and protect their rights.

I will be voting "yes" on this resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in doing so. Together, we can send a strong message to the administration that we will not stand idly by while they attempt to impose their will on our states and our communities.

Ron Wyden: I strongly disagree with the comments made by Senators Dan Sullivan, John Thune, Thomas Tillis, and Tommy Tuberville. As a senator from Oregon, I have seen firsthand the importance of protecting our environment and our natural resources. The revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule is a necessary step to protect our nation's water resources and ensure that our communities have access to clean and safe drinking water.

I would also like to respond to Senator Roger Wicker's comments by saying that I disagree with his assessment of the rule as a solution in search of a problem. The reality is that our nation's water resources are facing unprecedented threats, and we need to take bold action to protect them. This rule is a necessary step towards achieving that goal, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Todd Young: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must say that I strongly support the nullification of the revised definition of "Waters of the United States" rule. As a senator from Indiana, I have seen firsthand the impact that overregulation can have on our farmers, ranchers, and small businesses.
