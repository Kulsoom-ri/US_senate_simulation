Tammy Baldwin: The motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. As a senator who has long believed in the importance of Congressional oversight over war decisions, I must say that I am inclined to support this motion.

The War Powers Resolution is clear: it is the responsibility of Congress to declare war and authorize the deployment of our armed forces. Yet, for far too long, we have seen presidents from both parties unilaterally decide to engage our military in conflicts without seeking the necessary approval from Congress.

In the case of Syria, we have approximately 900 U.S. troops deployed without specific statutory authorization. This is unacceptable. As a nation, we must ensure that our military actions are guided by a clear strategy and a thorough understanding of the potential consequences. We must also ensure that our troops are not put in harm's way without the full support and authorization of the American people, as represented by their elected representatives in Congress.

S. J. Res. 51 is a straightforward resolution that seeks to restore Congressional oversight over our military actions in Syria. It does not authorize any new military action, but rather seeks to ensure that any continued involvement is subject to the approval of Congress. I believe this is a necessary step to ensure that we are not drawn into another endless conflict without a clear plan or exit strategy.

As a member of the Senate, I have a responsibility to uphold the Constitution and ensure that our nation's military actions are guided by the principles of transparency, accountability, and democratic oversight. For these reasons, I will be voting in favor of the motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this motion and in reaffirming the importance of Congressional oversight over our nation's war decisions. It is time for us to take our responsibilities seriously and to ensure that our military actions are guided by the will of the American people, rather than the whims of the executive branch.

Tom Cotton: I rise today to express my opposition to the motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. While I understand the importance of Congressional oversight over our nation's war decisions, I strongly believe that this resolution is misguided and would undermine our national security interests in Syria.

As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have had the opportunity to review the situation on the ground in Syria, and I can tell you that our military presence there is crucial to preventing the resurgence of ISIS and other terrorist groups. Our troops are working closely with our allies to stabilize the region, protect civilians, and prevent the spread of terrorism.

This resolution, introduced by Senator Rand Paul, would require the President to remove our troops from Syria within 30 days, unless Congress authorizes their presence. I believe this would be a reckless and irresponsible decision, as it would create a power vacuum that would be exploited by our enemies.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the lack of a clear plan or exit strategy in Syria, but I believe that we should be working to develop a comprehensive strategy that takes into account the complex geopolitical dynamics at play, rather than simply withdrawing our troops without a plan.

I also take issue with the notion that our military actions in Syria are not authorized by Congress. While it is true that we have not declared war on Syria, our military presence there is authorized under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that was passed in 2001, which gives the President the authority to use military force against terrorist organizations such as ISIS.

I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of this resolution, which could embolden our enemies, undermine our allies, and create instability in the region. Instead of withdrawing our troops, we should be working to develop a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of the conflict in Syria and promotes a lasting peace.

I will be voting against the motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution. We must prioritize our national security interests and work towards a solution that promotes stability and security in the region, rather than undermining our military presence and creating a power vacuum that would be exploited by our enemies.

The War Powers Resolution is clear: it is the responsibility of Congress to declare war and authorize the deployment of our armed forces. Yet, we have approximately 900 U.S. troops deployed in Syria without specific statutory authorization. This is a clear violation of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution.

I understand that some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of withdrawing our troops from Syria without a clear plan for the region's stability and security. I share these concerns, but I also believe that it is our responsibility as members of Congress to ensure that our military actions are guided by a clear strategy and the approval of Congress.

We cannot continue to allow the executive branch to unilaterally deploy our troops without Congressional approval. This is not only a matter of constitutional authority, but also a matter of accountability and transparency. The American people deserve to know why we are deploying our troops and what our goals are.

I would like to address the comments made by my colleagues, Senators Murphy, Murray, Ossoff, and Padilla. I appreciate their thoughtful and well-reasoned statements on this matter. I agree that we must consider the potential consequences of withdrawing our troops from Syria, but I also believe that we must take a stand and assert our constitutional authority over war.

I would like to provide more insight into my vision for the future of our military engagement in Syria. I believe that we must work towards a diplomatic solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict and promotes stability and security in the region. We must also ensure that our military actions are guided by a clear strategy and the approval of Congress.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. This is a necessary step towards reasserting Congress's constitutional authority over war and ensuring that our military actions are subject to the approval of the American people. Together, we can work towards a foreign policy that is both strong and responsible, reflecting the values and interests of the American people.

I will be voting in favor of this motion, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in taking a stand for Congressional oversight and accountability. Thank you.

James E. Risch: The motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

I think we need to take a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to our military engagement in Syria, one that considers the potential consequences of our actions and ensures that we're not putting our troops or our allies at risk.

So, I will be voting against the motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

This resolution, introduced by Senator Rand Paul, would require the President to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Syria within 30 days unless Congress authorizes their presence.

While I understand the concerns about Congressional oversight and the need for a clear strategy, I firmly believe that a hasty withdrawal from Syria would be a grave mistake. It would create a power vacuum that could be exploited by our adversaries, including terrorist organizations, and would undermine the progress we have made in the region.

As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have seen firsthand the importance of a strong and consistent military presence in the region. Our troops are deployed in Syria to combat ISIS and other terrorist groups, and their presence has been instrumental in preventing the spread of terrorism and protecting our national security interests.

I also believe that this resolution is premature and would undermine the authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief. The President has the constitutional authority to deploy our military forces as he sees fit, and Congress should not attempt to micromanage his decisions.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this resolution would send a signal to our allies and adversaries that we are not committed to our military engagements and that we are willing to abandon our responsibilities in the region. This would be a dangerous and irresponsible message to send, and it would undermine the credibility of the United States as a global leader.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject this motion and to instead work with the Administration to develop a comprehensive strategy for our military engagements in Syria and the broader region. We must ensure that our military actions are guided by a clear strategy and the approval of Congress, but we must also recognize the importance of a strong and consistent military presence in the region.

John Kennedy: The motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.  I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided to vote in favor of the motion. As a senator from Louisiana, I believe it's high time we reasserted Congress's authority over our nation's war decisions. The Constitution is clear: Congress has the sole authority to declare war. And yet, we've got approximately 900 U.S. troops deployed in Syria without specific statutory authorization. That's just not right.

Now, I know some of my colleagues are concerned about the potential consequences of withdrawing our troops from Syria without a clear plan. And I share those concerns. But I also believe that it's our responsibility as members of Congress to ensure that our military actions are guided by a clear strategy and the approval of Congress. We can't just let the executive branch unilaterally deploy our troops without our input. That's not how our system of government is supposed to work.

I've listened to my colleagues' comments, including those from Senators Hyde-Smith, Johnson, Kaine, and Kelly. And I agree with them: we need to take a stand and assert our authority over our nation's war decisions.

So, I'll be voting in favor of the motion to discharge S. J. Res. 51 from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion, and let's work together to find a solution that addresses the concerns raised by all senators and ensures that our military actions are subject to the approval of the American people.

And to my colleagues who are concerned about the potential consequences of withdrawing our troops from Syria, I say: let's have a thoughtful and deliberate discussion about our strategy in the region. Let's work together to develop a clear plan that takes into account the complexities of the situation and the potential risks and benefits of our actions. But let's not just sit back and allow the executive branch to make these decisions without our input. That's not what the Constitution intended, and it's not what the American people expect from us.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Paul, Van Hollen, Vance, Warner, Warnock, Warren, Welch, Whitehouse, and Wicker, who have emphasized the importance of Congressional oversight and the need for a clear strategy. The situation in Syria, where approximately 900 U.S. troops are deployed without specific statutory authorization, is a clear example of the need for Congressional action to ensure that our military engagements are subject to the approval of Congress.

I understand that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the potential consequences of withdrawing our troops from Syria without a clear plan.
