Tammy Baldwin: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I am compelled to express my strong opposition to S.J.Res.9, a joint resolution that seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the lesser prairie-chicken. This rule, which adds the Northern Distinct Population Segment to the list of threatened species and the Southern Distinct Population Segment to the list of endangered species, is a crucial step towards preserving the biodiversity of our nation.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always been committed to protecting our environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations. The lesser prairie-chicken is an iconic species that plays a vital role in the ecosystem of the Great Plains, and its decline is a stark reminder of the devastating impact of human activities on our environment.

I am deeply disappointed that the President has vetoed this resolution, and I am even more disappointed that my colleagues are attempting to override that veto. This joint resolution is not only bad for the environment, but it also undermines the scientific consensus and the careful consideration that went into the development of this rule.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have had the opportunity to review the evidence and consult with experts in the field. The overwhelming consensus is that the lesser prairie-chicken is in dire need of protection, and that this rule is a necessary step towards ensuring its survival.

I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term consequences of their actions. By overriding the President's veto, we would be sending a clear message that we are willing to sacrifice the well-being of our environment and our wildlife for short-term gains. I firmly believe that this is not a decision that we should take lightly, and I will be voting against this resolution.

I would like to address the concerns of my colleagues who may be worried about the economic impact of this rule. I understand that there may be concerns about the potential costs of implementing this rule, but I believe that these costs are far outweighed by the benefits of preserving our environment and protecting our wildlife.

Furthermore, I would like to point out that this rule is not a partisan issue. The protection of our environment and the preservation of our wildlife are values that transcend party lines, and I believe that we should be working together to find solutions that benefit all Americans.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing S.J.Res.9 and to prioritize the protection of our environment and the preservation of our wildlife. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to take action to preserve the beauty and wonder of our natural world. I will be voting against this resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in doing so.

John Barrasso: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I am compelled to express my strong support for S.J.Res.9, a joint resolution that seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the lesser prairie-chicken. This rule, which adds the Northern Distinct Population Segment to the list of threatened species and the Southern Distinct Population Segment to the list of endangered species, is a prime example of federal overreach and a threat to the economic well-being of my home state of Wyoming.

As a senator from Wyoming, I have always been committed to protecting the interests of my constituents and promoting responsible land use and energy development. The lesser prairie-chicken is an iconic species, but its protection should not come at the expense of our nation's energy security and economic growth. The rule issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would have far-reaching consequences for the oil and gas industry, agriculture, and other sectors that are critical to Wyoming's economy.

I understand that my colleague, Senator Baldwin, has expressed concerns about the potential impact of this resolution on the environment and the preservation of our natural resources. I respect her commitment to these values, but I must respectfully disagree with her assessment of this rule. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to list the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened or endangered is not supported by the best available science, and it would have devastating consequences for the people of Wyoming and other affected states.

I would like to address Senator Baldwin's point about the economic impact of this rule. While she suggests that the costs of implementing this rule are outweighed by the benefits of preserving our environment, I strongly disagree. The costs of this rule would be significant, and they would be borne disproportionately by the people of Wyoming and other energy-producing states. We cannot afford to sacrifice our economic well-being on the altar of environmental ideology.

Furthermore, I must correct Senator Baldwin's assertion that this is not a partisan issue. While I agree that the protection of our environment and the preservation of our wildlife are values that transcend party lines, the fact remains that this rule is a product of the Biden administration's radical environmental agenda. The President's veto of this resolution is a clear indication of his commitment to this agenda, and I believe that we must stand strong against it.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S.J.Res.9 and overriding the President's veto. We owe it to the people of Wyoming and other affected states to protect their economic interests and promote responsible land use and energy development. I will be voting in favor of this resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in doing so.

Regarding Senator Baldwin's comments, I would like to say that I understand her passion for environmental protection, but I believe that she is misguided on this issue. I would be happy to engage in a constructive dialogue with her and other colleagues to find solutions that balance our environmental and economic interests. However, on this particular issue, I must respectfully disagree with her assessment and vote in favor of S.J.Res.9.

I appreciate the comments of Senator Baldwin, who highlighted the importance of protecting our environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations. I also understand the concerns of Senator Barrasso, who pointed out the potential economic impact of this rule on his home state of Wyoming.

However, as a pragmatic progressive, I believe that we must find a balance between our environmental and economic interests. In this case, I believe that the benefits of protecting the lesser prairie-chicken outweigh the potential costs.

I would like to address Senator Barrasso's point about the economic impact of this rule. While I understand that the costs of implementing this rule may be significant, I believe that they are far outweighed by the long-term benefits of preserving our environment and protecting our wildlife.
