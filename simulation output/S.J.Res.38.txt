Tammy Baldwin: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I am compelled to express my strong opposition to S.J. Res. 32, which seeks to nullify the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. This rule, which was issued in February 2023, provides a temporary waiver for the Buy America requirements for steel, iron, manufactured products, and construction materials in electric vehicle chargers.

As a long-time advocate for Buy America requirements and domestic manufacturing, I believe that this rule is a step in the right direction. It will help to promote the use of American-made materials in the production of electric vehicle chargers, which is essential for creating jobs and stimulating economic growth in our country.

However, I also understand the concerns that have been raised about the potential impact of this rule on the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. That's why I appreciate the fact that the rule includes a phase-out provision, which will ensure that the waiver is only in place until July 1, 2024, and that the cost of U.S.-manufactured components does not exceed 55% of the total components cost.

Despite these provisions, I am disappointed that the President has chosen to veto this joint resolution. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have seen firsthand the importance of investing in our nation's infrastructure and promoting domestic manufacturing. This rule is a critical step towards achieving those goals, and I believe that it is essential that we override the President's veto.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, which will help to promote American jobs, stimulate economic growth, and ensure that our nation's infrastructure is built with American-made materials.

To my colleagues who may be considering voting against this resolution, I would say that this is not a partisan issue. This is about putting American workers and American manufacturers first. It's about ensuring that our nation's infrastructure is built with the best materials, made right here in the United States. I hope that we can put aside our differences and come together to support this important legislation.

Michael F. Bennet: I rise today to express my opposition to S.J. Res. 32, a joint resolution that seeks to nullify the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. As a senator from Colorado, I have always been committed to supporting American workers and manufacturers, and I believe that this rule is a step in the right direction.

The temporary waiver provided by this rule will help to promote the use of American-made materials in the production of electric vehicle chargers, which is essential for creating jobs and stimulating economic growth in our country. I also appreciate the fact that the rule includes a phase-out provision, which will ensure that the waiver is only in place until July 1, 2024, and that the cost of U.S.-manufactured components does not exceed 55% of the total components cost.

I understand that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the potential impact of this rule on the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. However, I believe that the benefits of this rule far outweigh any potential drawbacks. By promoting the use of American-made materials, we can create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and ensure that our nation's infrastructure is built with the best materials, made right here in the United States.

I am disappointed that the President has chosen to veto this joint resolution, and I believe that it is essential that we override the President's veto.

To my colleague, Senator Baldwin, I say that I agree with her sentiments. This is not a partisan issue, but rather an issue of putting American workers and manufacturers first. I hope that we can put aside our differences and come together to support this important legislation.

Therefore, I will be voting against overriding the President's veto, as I believe that the rule is a necessary step towards promoting American manufacturing and creating jobs. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and supporting the President's decision to veto it.

Marsha Blackburn: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I am compelled to express my strong support for S.J. Res. 32, which seeks to nullify the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. This rule, which was issued in February 2023, provides a temporary waiver for the Buy America requirements for steel, iron, manufactured products, and construction materials in electric vehicle chargers.

As a long-time advocate for fiscal conservatism and limited government intervention, I believe that this rule is a step in the wrong direction. It will lead to increased costs and bureaucratic red tape, which will stifle innovation and hinder the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Furthermore, I am concerned that this rule will create an uneven playing field, where American companies are forced to comply with onerous regulations, while foreign companies are free to operate without such constraints.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Baldwin and Bennet, may have concerns about the potential impact of this resolution on American workers and manufacturers. However, I believe that the benefits of promoting American-made materials can be achieved through more effective and efficient means, such as providing tax incentives or investing in workforce development programs.

I am pleased that the President has chosen to veto this joint resolution, and I believe that it is essential that we sustain the President's veto. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and supporting the President's decision to veto it.

To my colleagues who may be considering voting in favor of overriding the President's veto, I would say that this is not just a matter of promoting American jobs and manufacturing, but also about promoting free market principles and limited government intervention. We should be cautious about imposing unnecessary regulations and bureaucratic hurdles that can stifle innovation and hinder economic growth.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of sustaining the President's veto and opposing S.J. Res. 32. I hope that we can put aside our differences and come together to support policies that promote American prosperity, innovation, and economic growth.

Benjamin L. Cardin: As I consider the joint resolution S.J. Res. 32, I must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of nullifying the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. As a senator from Maryland, I have a strong interest in promoting American jobs and manufacturing, particularly in the tech and automotive sectors.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. While I understand the importance of promoting American-made materials, I believe that this rule is not the right approach. The temporary waiver provided by this rule may help to promote the use of American-made materials in the production of electric vehicle chargers, but it also raises concerns about the potential impact on free market principles and limited government intervention.

I appreciate the fact that the rule includes a phase-out provision, which will ensure that the waiver is only in place until July 1, 2024, and that the cost of U.S.-manufactured components does not exceed 55% of the total components cost. However, I believe that this provision is not enough to address the concerns about the potential impact on free market principles and limited government intervention.

I'd like to say to my colleagues that I understand the desire to promote American manufacturing and create jobs, but we must do so in a way that is responsible and considers the potential consequences of our actions. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. Let's work together to find alternative solutions that promote American prosperity and innovation while respecting free market principles and limited government intervention.

In response to my colleagues, Senators Padilla, Peters, and Reed, who have decided to vote against overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law, I understand their concerns, but I believe that this rule is an example of government overreach and that we must take a stand against it. I urge them to reconsider their position and join me in voting in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law.

I will be voting "yes" on S.J. Res. 32, and I urge my colleagues to join me in promoting American jobs and manufacturing while respecting free market principles and limited government intervention. 

I also appreciate the comments from my colleagues, Senators Ricketts, Risch, and Romney, who have expressed similar concerns about the rule and the need to promote American manufacturing and jobs. I agree with their assessment that this rule is not a balanced approach and that it prioritizes the interests of foreign manufacturers over American workers. I hope that we can work together to find alternative solutions that promote American prosperity and innovation while respecting free market principles and limited government intervention.

In contrast, I respectfully disagree with the comments from Senator Rosen, who believes that the temporary waiver is a necessary step to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers. While I understand the importance of investing in our nation's infrastructure, particularly in the energy sector, I believe that this rule is not the right approach. I urge Senator Rosen to reconsider her position and join me in voting in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law.

Marco Rubio: As the sponsor of S.J. Res. 32, I rise today to urge my colleagues to override the President's veto and allow this joint resolution to become law. The Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers is a clear example of government overreach and a threat to American jobs and manufacturing.

The Buy America requirements are in place to ensure that American-made materials are used in our nation's infrastructure, and this rule undermines those requirements. By waiving these requirements, we are essentially allowing foreign manufacturers to undercut American workers and companies, which will have a devastating impact on our economy.

I understand that some of my colleagues may believe that this rule is necessary to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers, but I strongly disagree. We can promote American innovation and manufacturing without sacrificing our values and principles. In fact, I believe that this rule will have the opposite effect, as it will prioritize the interests of foreign manufacturers over American workers.

I'd like to respond to my colleague, Senator Rosen, who believes that the temporary waiver is a necessary step to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers. While I understand her concerns, I believe that this rule is not the right approach. We should be promoting American manufacturing and jobs, not sacrificing them for the sake of foreign interests.

I'd also like to commend my colleagues, Senators Risch, Romney, and Rounds, who have expressed similar concerns about this rule and the need to promote American manufacturing and jobs. I agree with their assessment that this rule is not a balanced approach and that it prioritizes the interests of foreign manufacturers over American workers.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to override the President's veto and allow S.J. Res. 32 to become law. We must stand up for American workers and manufacturers, and we must promote American prosperity and innovation while respecting free market principles and limited government intervention. Let's work together to find alternative solutions that benefit our nation, not foreign interests. I will be voting "yes" on S.J. Res. 32, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort.

Brian Schatz: As I consider the joint resolution S.J. Res. 32, I must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of nullifying the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. As a senator from Hawaii, I have a strong interest in promoting American jobs and manufacturing, particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. I believe that the temporary waiver provided by this rule is a necessary step to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers and ensure that our nation's infrastructure is built with the best materials, made right here in the United States. The phase-out provision will ensure that the waiver is only in place until July 1, 2024, which I think is a reasonable approach.

I understand the concerns about the potential impact on American manufacturing and jobs, but I believe that this rule is a balanced approach that promotes American jobs and manufacturing while also respecting free market principles. I agree with my colleagues, Senators Kaine, Kelly, King, Klobuchar, Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Murkowski, Murray, Ossoff, and Padilla, who have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of overriding the President's veto and passing S.J.

Roger F. Wicker: As I consider the joint resolution S.J. Res. 32, I must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of nullifying the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. As a senator from Mississippi, I have a strong interest in promoting American jobs and manufacturing, particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors.

As a senator from Ohio, I have a strong interest in promoting American jobs and manufacturing, particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. I believe that the temporary waiver provided by this rule is a necessary step to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers and ensure that our nation's infrastructure is built with the best materials, made right here in the United States. The phase-out provision will ensure that the waiver is only in place until July 1, 2024, which I think is a reasonable approach.

I understand the concerns about the potential impact on American manufacturing and jobs, but I believe that this rule is a balanced approach that promotes American jobs and manufacturing while also respecting free market principles. I agree with my colleagues, Senators Booker, Warnock, and Warren, who have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of overriding the President's veto and passing S.J. Res. 32.

In Ohio, we have seen the importance of investing in our nation's infrastructure, particularly in the energy sector. As a strong supporter of American manufacturing and jobs, I believe that we must approach this issue in a way that prioritizes American workers and American-made materials, but also recognizes the need for flexibility and adaptability in the face of changing market conditions.

I'd like to say to my colleagues that I understand the desire to promote American manufacturing and create jobs, but we must do so in a way that is responsible and considers the potential consequences of our actions. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. Let's work together to find alternative solutions that promote American prosperity and innovation while respecting free market principles and limited government intervention.

In response to my colleagues, Senators Boozman, Braun, and Britt, who have decided to vote in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law, I understand their concerns, but I believe that this rule is a necessary step to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers and ensure that our nation's infrastructure is built with the best materials, made right here in the United States. I urge them to reconsider their position and join me in voting against overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law.

I will be voting "no" on S.J. Res. 32, and I urge my colleagues to join me in promoting American jobs and manufacturing while respecting free market principles and limited government intervention.

Ted Budd: As I consider the joint resolution S.J. Res. 32, I must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of nullifying the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. As a senator from North Carolina, I have a strong interest in promoting American jobs and manufacturing, particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. I believe that the temporary waiver provided by this rule is a misguided step that undermines American manufacturing and jobs. The Buy America requirements are in place to ensure that our nation's infrastructure is built with American-made materials, and waiving these requirements would only serve to benefit foreign companies at the expense of American workers.

I understand the concerns about the potential impact on the deployment of electric vehicle chargers, but I believe that this rule is an example of government overreach and that it is not a necessary step to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers. I agree with my colleagues, Senators Risch, Romney, and Rounds, who have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of allowing this rule to stand.

In North Carolina, we have seen the importance of investing in our nation's infrastructure, particularly in the energy sector. As a strong supporter of American manufacturing and jobs, I believe that we must approach this issue in a way that prioritizes American workers and American-made materials. Therefore, I will be voting "yes" on overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law.

Angus S. King Jr.: The debate on S.J. Res. 32 has been quite lively, and I appreciate the thoughtful consideration of this issue by my colleagues. As an independent senator from Maine, I've always tried to approach issues with a pragmatic and bipartisan mindset.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law.

Marco Rubio: As the sponsor of S.J. Res. 32, I rise today to urge my colleagues to override the President's veto and pass this critical joint resolution. The Federal Highway Administration's final rule waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers is a threat to American manufacturing and jobs. By allowing foreign-made components to be used in EV chargers, we are undermining the very purpose of the Buy America Act, which is to promote American industry and create good-paying jobs for American workers.

I understand that some of my colleagues may argue that this waiver is necessary to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. But I firmly believe that we can achieve these goals without sacrificing American jobs and industries. In fact, the phase-out provision in the rule, which requires that the cost of U.S. manufactured components does not exceed 55% of the total components cost for EV chargers manufactured after July 1, 2024, is a clear indication that the administration recognizes the importance of promoting American manufacturing.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Pete Ricketts, James E. Risch, and Mitt Romney, who have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of not overriding the President's veto and passing S.J. Res. 32.

To those who argue that this waiver is necessary to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers, I say that we must not sacrifice American jobs and industries on the altar of expediency. We can promote clean energy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels without undermining American manufacturing. In fact, by promoting American-made EV chargers, we can create good-paying jobs, stimulate economic growth, and reduce our trade deficit.

I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to override the President's veto and pass S.J. Res. 32. Let us stand up for American workers, American industries, and American jobs. Let us show that we are committed to promoting American prosperity and innovation, while respecting our values and protecting our environment.

To Senators Jacky Rosen and others who have decided to vote against S.J. Res. 32, I respect your opinions, but I must respectfully disagree.

John Thune: As I consider the joint resolution S.J. Res. 32, I must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of nullifying the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. As a senator from South Dakota, I have a strong interest in promoting American manufacturing and supporting the development of our nation's infrastructure.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. I believe that the temporary waiver provided by this rule undermines the importance of American manufacturing and could potentially harm our nation's economic interests. The Buy America requirements are in place to ensure that American tax dollars are used to support American jobs and industries, and waiving these requirements could lead to unintended consequences.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Tina Smith, Debbie Stabenow, and Jon Tester, have expressed support for the temporary waiver and the deployment of electric vehicle chargers. However, I must respectfully disagree with their assessment. While I agree that promoting clean energy and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels is important, I believe that we must do so in a way that supports American manufacturing and jobs.

Tommy Tuberville: Folks, I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville from Alabama, and I'm here to give you my two cents on this joint resolution S.J. Res. 32. As a Christian conservative, I believe in standing up for American values and supporting our great nation's economic interests.

Now, I've heard some of my colleagues, like Senators Dan Sullivan, John Thune, and Thomas Tillis, express their concerns about the temporary waiver of Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. And I gotta say, I agree with them. We can't just let foreign industries come in here and take advantage of us. We need to support American manufacturing and jobs, and that's exactly what this joint resolution does.

I know some folks, like Senators Jon Tester and Kyrsten Sinema, think that this waiver is necessary to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers. But I say, why can't we do that in a way that supports American workers and industries? We can't just sacrifice our economic interests for the sake of clean energy. That's not the American way.

Now, I'm not against clean energy, folks. I think it's a great idea. But we need to do it in a way that puts America first. And that's exactly what this joint resolution does. It says, "Hey, we're gonna support American manufacturing, and we're gonna make sure that our tax dollars are used to create American jobs."

So, I'm gonna vote "yes" on S.J. Res. 32. I think it's the right thing to do for America, and I think it's the right thing to do for the people of Alabama. We need to stand up for our nation's economic interests, and we need to support American workers and industries. That's the Tuberville way, folks.

Chris Van Hollen: As I consider the joint resolution S.J.

Roger F. Wicker: As I rise to address the joint resolution S.J. Res. 32, I must consider the potential implications of nullifying the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. As a senator from Mississippi, I have a strong interest in promoting American manufacturing and supporting the development of our nation's infrastructure, while also considering the needs of our environment and the well-being of our citizens.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. I believe that the waiver of Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers is unnecessary and could potentially harm American manufacturing and jobs. The Buy America requirements are in place to ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to support American businesses and workers, and waiving these requirements could lead to foreign companies benefiting from our infrastructure investments.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, Peter Welch, and Sheldon Whitehouse, have expressed support for the temporary waiver and the deployment of electric vehicle chargers. However, I must respectfully disagree. I believe that the waiver is not necessary to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers, and that it could ultimately harm American manufacturing and jobs.

In fact, I am concerned that the waiver could lead to a flood of foreign-made electric vehicle chargers into the US market, which could undermine the competitiveness of American manufacturers. I also believe that the phase-out provision in the rule, which requires that the cost of U.S. manufactured components does not exceed 55% of the total components cost for EV chargers manufactured after July 1, 2024, is not sufficient to protect American manufacturing and jobs.

As a senator, I have always been committed to finding solutions that balance our economic and environmental needs. However, in this case, I believe that voting in favor of S.J. Res. 32 is a critical step in protecting American manufacturing and jobs. I will be voting "yes" on S.J.

I also appreciate the thoughtful consideration of this issue by Senator Josh Hawley, who has highlighted the importance of promoting American manufacturing and jobs.

In response to my colleagues who have decided to vote in favor of S.J. Res. 32, such as Senators Marco Rubio, Mike Rounds, and Eric Schmitt, I respect their opinions, but I must respectfully disagree. I believe that the temporary waiver is necessary to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers, and that it will ultimately support American manufacturing and jobs in the long term.

As a senator, I have always been committed to finding solutions that balance our economic and environmental needs. I believe that voting against S.J. Res. 32 is a critical step in achieving that goal. I will be voting "no" on S.J. Res. 32, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential benefits of promoting the deployment of electric vehicle chargers.

To my colleagues who have spoken on this issue, I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of this matter.

Senator Hickenlooper, I agree with your emphasis on the importance of investing in clean energy, and I believe that the temporary waiver will help to support the development of this critical sector.

Let's work together to find solutions that promote American prosperity and innovation while respecting our values and protecting our environment. I am committed to finding solutions that balance our economic and environmental needs, and I believe that voting against S.J. Res. 32 is a critical step in achieving that goal.

In particular, I'd like to respond to Senator J.D. Vance's comments. While I understand his concerns about supporting American workers and industries, I believe that the temporary waiver will ultimately support American manufacturing and jobs in the long term. I am committed to finding solutions that balance our economic and environmental needs, and I believe that voting against S.J. Res. 32 is a critical step in achieving that goal.

In conclusion, I will be voting "no" on S.J. Res. 32, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential benefits of promoting the deployment of electric vehicle chargers. Let's work together to find solutions that promote American prosperity and innovation while respecting our values and protecting our environment. I believe that voting against S.J.

Todd Young: As I consider the joint resolution S.J. Res. 32, I must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of nullifying the Federal Highway Administration's final rule on waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers. As a senator from Indiana, I have a strong interest in promoting American manufacturing and supporting the development of our nation's infrastructure, while also considering the needs of our environment and the well-being of our citizens.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of overriding the President's veto and allowing S.J. Res. 32 to become law. I believe that the waiver of Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers is unnecessary and could potentially harm American manufacturing and jobs. The Buy America requirements are in place to ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to support American businesses and workers, and waiving these requirements could lead to foreign companies benefiting from our infrastructure investments.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, Peter Welch, and Sheldon Whitehouse, have expressed support for the temporary waiver and the deployment of electric vehicle chargers. However, I must respectfully disagree. I believe that the waiver is not necessary to promote the deployment of electric vehicle chargers, and that it could ultimately harm American manufacturing and jobs.

In fact, I am concerned that the waiver could lead to a flood of foreign-made electric vehicle chargers into the US market, which could undermine the competitiveness of American manufacturers. I also believe that the phase-out provision in the rule, which requires that the cost of U.S. manufactured components does not exceed 55% of the total components cost for EV chargers manufactured after July 1, 2024, is not sufficient to protect American manufacturing and jobs.

As a senator, I have always been committed to finding solutions that balance our economic and environmental needs. However, in this case, I believe that voting in favor of S.J. Res. 32 is a critical step in protecting American manufacturing and jobs. I will be voting "yes" on S.J. Res. 32, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential risks of waiving Buy America requirements for electric vehicle chargers.
