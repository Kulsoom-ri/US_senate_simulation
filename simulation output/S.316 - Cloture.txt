Tom Cotton: I rise today to express my strong opposition to the cloture motion on the bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq.

Tim Kaine: My fellow senators, I rise today to urge you to support cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill, which would repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. As the sponsor of this bill, I've had the opportunity to work with many of you across the aisle to address concerns and find common ground.

I want to start by thanking Senators Hirono and Hickenlooper for their thoughtful comments and their support for this bill. I also appreciate the concerns raised by Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, and I'd like to address some of the questions they've posed.

First, let me be clear: repealing these authorizations is not a decision we take lightly. However, I firmly believe that it's time for us to reexamine our approach to national security and ensure that it aligns with our values and our constitutional responsibilities. These authorizations have been in place for decades, and it's time for us to take a more nuanced approach that considers the complexities of the situation on the ground and the potential consequences of our actions.

To those who have expressed concerns about the potential impact on our national security interests, I want to assure you that we've thoughtfully considered these issues. We've worked with our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Intelligence Committee to ensure that we're taking a comprehensive approach to addressing the ongoing security challenges in the region.

So, what's the plan? Well, first and foremost, we need to recognize that our military interventions must be subject to rigorous debate and oversight. We owe it to our troops, our veterans, and the American people to ensure that we're using our military power wisely and only when necessary.

To address the ongoing security challenges in the region, we need to work with our allies and partners to develop a clear strategy for maintaining stability and security. This may involve a combination of diplomatic, economic, and military efforts, but it must be a coordinated and sustainable approach that takes into account the complexities of the region.

I'd like to address the question posed by several of my colleagues about how we would ensure that our national security interests are protected if these authorizations are repealed. The answer is that we would work with our allies and partners to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the ongoing security challenges in the region. This plan would include a clear strategy for maintaining stability and security, as well as a plan for ensuring that our national security interests are protected.

For example, we could work with our allies to establish a regional security framework that brings together countries in the region to address common security challenges. We could also provide training and assistance to local security forces to help them build their capacity to address security challenges. And we could work with our allies to develop a coordinated approach to counterterrorism, one that takes into account the complexities of the region and the need for a sustainable and long-term approach.

I understand that some of my colleagues may still have concerns about the potential consequences of repealing these authorizations. I respect those concerns, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that addresses the concerns of all parties involved.

But I urge you, my fellow senators, to consider the long-term implications of our actions. If we fail to repeal these authorizations, we'll be perpetuating a system that allows the executive branch to unilaterally decide when and where to use military force, without sufficient oversight or debate. That's not what our Constitution intended, and it's not what our troops and veterans deserve.

So, I ask for your support on this cloture vote. Let's take a step towards reasserting Congress's constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. Let's work together to find a solution that balances our national security interests with our constitutional responsibilities. And let's ensure that our military interventions are subject to rigorous debate and oversight, so that we can make informed decisions that align with our values and our interests. Thank you.

John Kennedy: The bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq.  I've listened to my colleagues' comments, and I must say, I'm not convinced that repealing these authorizations is the right course of action at this time.

As a member of the Senate, I believe it's our duty to prioritize the safety and security of our nation above all else. And I'm not sure that repealing these authorizations aligns with that duty. The situation in Iraq and the surrounding region is still volatile, and I fear that repealing these authorizations could create a power vacuum that would be exploited by our enemies.

I understand the desire to reassert Congress's constitutional authority over matters of war and peace, but I believe we must take a more cautious approach. We owe it to our troops, our veterans, and the American people to ensure that our military interventions are subject to rigorous debate and oversight, but we must also consider the potential consequences of our actions.

I'd like to ask Senator Kaine, what's the plan for addressing the ongoing security challenges in the region if these authorizations are repealed? How would we ensure that our national security interests are protected, and that our troops and allies are not put at risk? I've heard some discussion about working with our allies and partners to develop a comprehensive plan, but I'm not convinced that's enough.

I'm also concerned that repealing these authorizations would send the wrong signal to our enemies. It would suggest that we're not committed to maintaining stability and security in the region, and that we're willing to abandon our allies and partners.

So, after careful consideration, I've decided to vote against cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. I believe that we must take a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to this issue, and that we must consider the potential consequences of our actions before repealing these authorizations.

To my colleagues who have expressed support for the bill, I would say that I understand and respect their perspectives, but I believe that we must prioritize the safety and security of our nation above all else. I'm willing to work with my colleagues to find a solution that addresses the concerns of all parties involved, but I believe that repealing these authorizations at this time is not the right approach.

Let's take a step back, and let's think about the long-term implications of our actions. Let's consider the potential consequences of creating a power vacuum in the region, and let's think about how we can work with our allies and partners to maintain stability and security. That's the approach I believe we should take, and that's why I'll be voting against cloture on this bill.

Rand Paul: The bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. I've given this a lot of thought, and I have to say, I'm inclined to support it. As a senator who's always been skeptical of our military interventions, I believe it's high time we reassert Congress's constitutional authority over matters of war and peace.

I understand the concerns raised by some of my colleagues about the potential risks of repealing these authorizations without a clear plan in place to address the ongoing security challenges in the region. But I think it's equally important to consider the potential consequences of perpetuating a system that allows the executive branch to unilaterally decide when and where to use military force, without sufficient oversight or debate.

As a libertarian, I've always believed in a more restrained approach to foreign policy, one that prioritizes diplomacy and cooperation over military intervention. And I think repealing these authorizations is a necessary step towards a more responsible and transparent approach to national security.

Now, I know some of my colleagues are worried about the potential power vacuum that could be created by repealing these authorizations. But I think that's a false dichotomy. We can repeal these authorizations and still work towards a comprehensive plan to address the ongoing security challenges in the region.

In fact, I think repealing these authorizations could actually help to reduce the risk of further military intervention, by forcing us to think more carefully about our national security interests and how to achieve them. And I'm willing to work with my colleagues to develop a plan that balances our national security interests with our constitutional responsibilities.

So, I'll be voting in favor of cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. I believe it's time for us to take a more nuanced approach to national security, one that considers the complexities of the situation on the ground and the potential consequences of our actions. And I'm committed to working with my colleagues to find a solution that balances our national security interests with our constitutional responsibilities and ensures that our military interventions are subject to rigorous debate and oversight.

To my colleagues who are concerned about the potential risks of repealing these authorizations, I say: let's work together to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the ongoing security challenges in the region. Let's prioritize diplomacy and cooperation, and let's make sure that any military intervention is subject to rigorous oversight and debate. I'm confident that, together, we can find a way to repeal these authorizations while also ensuring the safety and security of our nation and our allies.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm a straightforward fella, and I'll tell you where I stand on this issue. As a senator from Alabama, I've always put the safety and security of our nation first. And I gotta say, I'm not convinced that repealing the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq is the right move.

Now, I understand where Senators Kaine, Stabenow, and Tester are coming from. They want to reassert Congress's constitutional authority over matters of war and peace, and I respect that.

Roger F. Wicker: The bill to repeal the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. I've given this a lot of thought, and I have to say, I'm not convinced that repealing these authorizations is the right move at this time.

While I understand the concerns about the executive branch's authority to unilaterally decide when and where to use military force, I believe that we need to be careful about how we approach this issue.

But I'm not convinced that this is the right approach. I think we need to take a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to addressing the security challenges in the region. We need to make sure that we're not leaving a vacuum that could be filled by our enemies, and that we're not putting our troops and our allies at risk.

However, I believe that we must be willing to take a thoughtful and deliberate approach to national security, and that includes being willing to reexamine and update our authorizations for use of military force. I am confident that we can work together to find a solution that prioritizes our national security interests and promotes stability and security in the region.

As I often say, "We must be vigilant in our pursuit of peace and security," and I believe that repealing these authorizations is a step in the right direction. I look forward to working with my colleagues to find a solution that promotes peace, justice, and human rights.

Todd Young: The issue at hand is the repeal of the authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. As a senator from Indiana and a member of the Republican Party, I have given this matter careful consideration. I agree with my colleagues, including Senator Kaine, that it's essential to reassert Congress's constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. The original authorizations were passed over two decades ago, and it's time for us to reexamine and update them.

As a former Marine, I understand the importance of a strong and effective national security strategy. However, I also believe that our military interventions should be subject to rigorous debate and oversight. I've worked with Senator Kaine on this issue, and I appreciate his efforts to bring attention to the need for congressional oversight and accountability.

While I understand the concerns raised by some of my colleagues about the potential risks of repealing these authorizations without a clear plan in place, I believe that we must take a thoughtful and deliberate approach to national security. This includes being willing to reexamine and update our authorizations for use of military force, and ensuring that our military interventions are aligned with our values and our constitutional responsibilities.

Therefore, I will vote Yea on the cloture motion. I believe that this bill is a necessary step towards reasserting our constitutional authority and ensuring that our military interventions are subject to rigorous debate and oversight. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and to work with me to find a solution that prioritizes our national security interests and promotes stability and security in the region.
