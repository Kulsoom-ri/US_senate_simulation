Tammy Baldwin: The bill before us today, which reauthorizes Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for five years and makes changes to FISA, is a complex and critical piece of legislation. As a senator who has long been committed to protecting the civil liberties of all Americans, I have significant concerns about the potential for abuse of surveillance powers under FISA.

While I understand the need for our intelligence agencies to have the tools they need to keep our country safe, I also believe that we must ensure that those tools are used in a way that respects the constitutional rights of all Americans. The provisions in this bill that place statutory limits on querying the contents of information collected under Section 702 are a step in the right direction, but I fear that they may not go far enough to prevent abuse.

I am particularly concerned about the fact that this bill does not provide adequate safeguards to prevent the use of FISA surveillance powers for domestic law enforcement purposes. As we have seen in the past, the line between foreign intelligence gathering and domestic law enforcement can become blurred, and it is essential that we have strong safeguards in place to prevent the misuse of these powers.

Furthermore, I am disappointed that this bill does not include stronger provisions to increase transparency and oversight of FISA surveillance activities. The American people have a right to know how their government is using its surveillance powers, and it is our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that we are providing adequate oversight and accountability.

In light of these concerns, I will be voting against cloture on the motion to proceed. I believe that we need to take a more careful and deliberative approach to reauthorizing FISA, one that prioritizes the protection of civil liberties and ensures that our intelligence agencies are using their surveillance powers in a responsible and transparent manner.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing cloture and to work with me to craft a bill that truly balances our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.

John Barrasso: As I consider the bill reauthorizing Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for five years, I must weigh the need for our intelligence agencies to have the tools they need to keep our country safe against the potential risks to the civil liberties of all Americans. While I appreciate the efforts to place statutory limits on querying the contents of information collected under Section 702, I believe these provisions are a step in the right direction but may not go far enough to prevent abuse.

I share some of the concerns expressed by my colleague, Senator Tammy Baldwin, regarding the potential for the use of FISA surveillance powers for domestic law enforcement purposes and the need for stronger provisions to increase transparency and oversight of FISA surveillance activities. However, I also recognize the importance of giving our intelligence agencies the tools they need to protect our national security.

As a member of the Senate, I have a responsibility to balance these competing interests. After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of cloture on the motion to proceed. I believe that this bill, while imperfect, represents a necessary step forward in reauthorizing FISA and providing our intelligence agencies with the tools they need to keep our country safe.

I will continue to work with my colleagues to address the concerns that have been raised and to ensure that any final bill prioritizes the protection of civil liberties while also meeting our national security needs. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting cloture and allowing this important bill to move forward for further consideration and debate.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting cloture and allowing this important bill to move forward for further consideration and debate.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting cloture and to work with me to craft a bill that truly balances our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. We must ensure that any final bill includes stronger provisions to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers, increases transparency and oversight, and prioritizes the protection of civil liberties.

To my colleagues, I urge you to consider the potential benefits of this bill and the need for our intelligence agencies to have the tools they need to keep our country safe. I am committed to working with you to strengthen the provisions and ensure that any final bill includes robust safeguards to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.

Hickenlooper: As I consider the bill reauthorizing Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for five years, I must weigh the need for our intelligence agencies to have the tools they need to keep our country safe against the potential risks to the civil liberties of all Americans. As a senator from Colorado and a strong advocate for balanced approaches, I have always been committed to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans while ensuring that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to keep our country safe.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against cloture on the motion to proceed. While I appreciate the efforts to increase transparency and oversight of FISA surveillance activities, I believe that the provisions in this bill do not go far enough to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers and protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.

I understand and respect the concerns expressed by my colleagues, including Senators Margaret Wood Hassan, Josh Hawley, and Martin Heinrich, regarding the potential for abuse of surveillance powers under FISA. I agree with them that we need to take a more careful and deliberative approach to reauthorizing FISA, one that prioritizes the protection of civil liberties while also ensuring that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to keep our country safe.

In response to my colleagues' comments, I appreciate the thoughtful discussion and the concerns that have been raised. However, I do not believe that this bill does enough to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers and protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. I am particularly concerned about the lack of robust safeguards to prevent the targeting of certain groups, such as minorities and political dissidents, and the insufficient oversight mechanisms to ensure that intelligence agencies are using their surveillance powers in a way that respects the constitutional rights of all Americans.

Ultimately, I believe that we must prioritize the protection of civil liberties while also ensuring that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to keep our country safe. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing cloture and to work with me to craft a bill that truly balances our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. We must ensure that any final bill includes stronger provisions to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers, increases transparency and oversight, and prioritizes the protection of civil liberties.

To my colleagues, I urge you to consider the potential risks of this bill and the need for more robust safeguards to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. I am committed to working with you to strengthen the provisions and ensure that any final bill includes robust safeguards to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.

While I understand and respect the concerns expressed by my colleagues, including Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Kelly, regarding the potential for abuse of surveillance powers under FISA, I believe that the provisions in this bill strike a reasonable balance between our national security needs and our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.

I appreciate the efforts to increase transparency and oversight of FISA surveillance activities, and I believe that the bill's provisions, such as the requirement for sworn statements and the limitation on the use of information derived from political organizations or media sources, will help to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers. Additionally, the bill's provisions regarding the querying of U.S. person information, including the requirement for prior approval by certain FBI supervisors or attorneys, will help to ensure that our intelligence agencies are using their surveillance powers in a way that respects the constitutional rights of all Americans.

In response to my colleagues' comments, I appreciate the thoughtful discussion and the concerns that have been raised. However, I believe that this bill is a step in the right direction and that it provides a necessary framework for our intelligence agencies to operate while also protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.

I would like to address the concerns raised by Senators Kaine and Kelly regarding the potential risks of this bill. While I understand their concerns, I believe that the bill's provisions will help to mitigate those risks. I also appreciate their concerns about the lack of robust safeguards to prevent the targeting of certain groups, and I believe that the bill's provisions regarding the querying of U.S. person information will help to address those concerns.

Ultimately, I believe that we must prioritize the protection of civil liberties while also ensuring that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to keep our country safe. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting cloture and to work with me to pass a bill that truly balances our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.

I will vote "yea" on cloture.

However, I do not believe that this bill does enough to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers and protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.

I would like to address the comments made by Senators James Lankford, Mike Lee, Cynthia Lummis, and Joe Manchin, who have expressed support for the bill. While I understand their perspectives, I believe that we must be more cautious and ensure that any reauthorization of FISA includes stronger provisions to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.

Ultimately, I believe that we must prioritize the protection of civil liberties while also ensuring that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to keep our country safe. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing cloture and to work with me to craft a bill that truly balances our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.

In response to Senators Murphy, Murray, and Ossoff, I agree that we need to take a more careful and deliberative approach to reauthorizing FISA.

These provisions will help to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers and protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.

Benjamin L.

As a senator from Vermont and a strong advocate for civil liberties, I have always been committed to ensuring that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to keep our country safe while also safeguarding the constitutional rights of all Americans.

While I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to balance national security and civil liberties, I believe that this bill does not go far enough to protect the rights of all Americans. The provisions in this bill, such as the prohibition on FBI personnel making U.S. person queries without prior approval and the requirement for the FBI Deputy Director to approve certain politically sensitive query terms, are important measures, but they are not sufficient to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers.

I understand and respect the concerns expressed by my colleagues who have expressed support for the bill, but I strongly believe that we must take a more robust approach to protecting civil liberties. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential risks to the constitutional rights of all Americans and to work towards a final product that truly balances our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.

In light of these concerns, I will be voting "nay" on cloture. I believe that we must take a more careful and nuanced approach to reauthorizing FISA, one that prioritizes the protection of civil liberties and ensures that our intelligence agencies are not given unchecked power to surveil American citizens.

To my colleagues who have expressed support for the bill, I say that I understand and respect your perspectives, but I urge you to consider the long-term implications of this bill and the potential risks to the constitutional rights of all Americans.

In particular, I would like to address the comments made by Senators Risch, Romney, Rosen, Rounds, and Rubio, who have expressed support for the bill. While I appreciate their thoughtful consideration of this bill, I must respectfully disagree with their conclusion that this bill is a sufficient step towards balancing national security and civil liberties. I believe that we must do more to protect the rights of all Americans, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing cloture and working towards a more robust and protective bill.

I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to refine and improve this bill, and I am confident that together, we can create a final product that truly balances our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.

In conclusion, I believe that this bill requires further refinement and improvement to truly balance our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. I will continue to work with my colleagues to refine and improve this bill as it moves through the legislative process, and I am committed to protecting the rights of all Americans. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing cloture and working towards a final product that truly balances our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. I will vote "nay" on cloture.

Roger F. Wicker: As I consider the bill reauthorizing Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for five years, I must weigh the need for our intelligence agencies to have the tools they need to keep our country safe against the potential risks to the civil liberties of all Americans. As a senator from Mississippi and a strong advocate for national security, I have always been committed to ensuring that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to keep our country safe while also safeguarding the constitutional rights of all Americans.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of cloture on the motion to proceed. While I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleagues regarding the potential for abuse of surveillance powers under FISA, I believe that this bill takes significant steps in the right direction to balance our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. The provisions in this bill, such as the prohibition on FBI personnel making U.S. person queries without prior approval and the requirement for the FBI Deputy Director to approve certain politically sensitive query terms, are important measures that will help prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers.

I understand and respect the concerns expressed by my colleagues, including Senators Warren, Welch, and Whitehouse, who have expressed concerns that this bill does not go far enough to protect civil liberties. However, I believe that this bill is a good starting point, and I am committed to working with my colleagues to refine and improve this bill as it moves through the legislative process.

In particular, I would like to respond to the comments made by Senator Warren, who stated that this bill does not go far enough to protect civil liberties. I respect Senator Warren's concerns, and I believe that we must do more to protect civil liberties. However, I also believe that we must be realistic about the threats that our country faces, and we must give our intelligence agencies the tools they need to keep us safe.

Ron Wyden: As I consider the bill reauthorizing Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for five years, I must weigh the need for our intelligence agencies to have the tools they need to keep our country safe against the potential risks to the civil liberties of all Americans. As a senator from Oregon and a strong advocate for civil liberties, I have always been committed to ensuring that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to keep our country safe while also safeguarding the constitutional rights of all Americans.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against cloture on the motion to proceed. While I appreciate the efforts made by the bill's sponsors to address concerns about the potential for abuse of surveillance powers under FISA, I believe that this bill does not go far enough to protect civil liberties. The provisions in this bill, such as the prohibition on FBI personnel making U.S. person queries without prior approval and the requirement for the FBI Deputy Director to approve certain politically sensitive query terms, are important measures, but I am concerned that they may not be sufficient to prevent the misuse of FISA surveillance powers.

I understand and respect the concerns expressed by my colleagues regarding the potential for abuse of surveillance powers under FISA, and I agree that we must take a balanced approach to national security and civil liberties. However, I believe that this bill requires further refinement and improvement to truly balance our national security needs with our commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.

I would like to address the comments made by Senators Peter Welch and Sheldon Whitehouse, who have expressed similar concerns about the bill's ability to protect civil liberties. I agree with their concerns, and I believe that we must do more to protect civil liberties.
