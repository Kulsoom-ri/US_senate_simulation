Tammy Baldwin: As I consider the bill to reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), I must weigh the need for national security against the importance of protecting the civil liberties of American citizens. While I understand the importance of surveillance in preventing terrorist attacks and protecting our nation, I also believe that we must ensure that such surveillance is conducted in a manner that respects the rights of all individuals.

The bill before us includes some provisions that I believe are steps in the right direction, such as the requirement for prior approval by FBI supervisors or attorneys for U.S. person queries and the prohibition on the involvement of political appointees in the approval process for such queries. However, I am concerned that the bill does not go far enough to address the potential for abuse of surveillance powers.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always been committed to protecting the rights of my constituents and ensuring that our government is transparent and accountable. In light of the amendments that were proposed and voted on in the Senate, I am disappointed that some of the more robust protections for civil liberties were not adopted.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the bill. While I believe that FISA reauthorization is necessary, I think that this bill falls short of the mark in terms of protecting the rights of American citizens. I hope that in the future, we can work towards a more balanced approach that prioritizes both national security and civil liberties.

In particular, I was disappointed that the amendment proposed by Senator Paul, which would have prohibited the use of FISA authorities to surveil U.S. persons, was not adopted. I also was concerned that the amendment proposed by Senator Wyden, which would have struck the definition of electronic communication service provider, was not agreed to.

As a member of the Senate, I will continue to advocate for stronger protections for civil liberties and work towards a more balanced approach to national security. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and to prioritize the rights of American citizens in any future legislation related to FISA reauthorization.

Benjamin L. Cardin: As I consider the bill to reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), I must weigh the need for national security against the importance of protecting the civil liberties of American citizens. As a senator from Maryland, I have always been committed to protecting the rights of my constituents and ensuring that our government is transparent and accountable.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the bill. While I believe that FISA reauthorization is necessary, I think that this bill falls short of the mark in terms of protecting the rights of American citizens. The provisions in the bill, such as the requirement for prior approval by FBI supervisors or attorneys for U.S. person queries and the prohibition on the involvement of political appointees in the approval process for such queries, are steps in the right direction, but I believe that more needs to be done to prevent abuse of surveillance powers.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Budd and Britt, have expressed support for the bill, citing the need for national security and the provisions that restrict the use of FISA authorities to surveil U.S. persons. I respect their concerns and appreciate their commitment to protecting the rights of American citizens. However, I believe that the bill's provisions do not go far enough to address the potential for abuse of surveillance powers.

In particular, I am concerned that the bill does not provide sufficient safeguards to prevent the use of FISA authorities to surveil U.S. persons without a warrant. I also believe that the bill's emphasis on transparency and accountability is not sufficient, and that more needs to be done to ensure that the FBI is held accountable for its actions.

Tammy Duckworth: As I consider the bill to reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), I must weigh the need for national security against the importance of protecting the civil liberties of American citizens. As a senator from Illinois, I have always been committed to protecting the rights of my constituents and ensuring that our government is transparent and accountable.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the bill. While I believe that the provisions in the bill, such as the requirement for prior approval by FBI supervisors or attorneys for U.S. person queries and the prohibition on the involvement of political appointees in the approval process for such queries, are important safeguards to prevent the misuse of FISA authorities, I do not think that the bill goes far enough to protect the rights of American citizens.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Cramer, Crapo, Cruz, and Daines, have expressed support for the bill and believe that it strikes a necessary balance between national security and civil liberties. However, I respectfully disagree with their assessment. I believe that the bill's provisions do not provide sufficient protections for American citizens, and I am concerned that the bill could be used to justify unwarranted surveillance and erosion of our civil liberties.

In particular, I am concerned that the bill does not do enough to prevent the abuse of surveillance powers and to ensure that those who abuse their power are held accountable. I believe that the bill's provisions related to criminal penalties and adverse consequences for government officers and employees who engage in intentional misconduct are insufficient, and I would like to see stronger measures in place to prevent abuse and ensure accountability.

I would like to respond to the comments made by my colleagues who have expressed support for the bill.

In particular, I am pleased that the bill increases criminal penalties related to FISA and requires adverse consequences for government officers and employees who engage in intentional misconduct with respect to proceedings before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. These provisions will help to ensure that those who abuse their power are held accountable.

Martin Heinrich: As I consider the bill to reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), I must weigh the need for national security against the importance of protecting the civil liberties of American citizens. As a senator from New Mexico, I have always been committed to protecting the rights of my constituents and ensuring that our government is transparent and accountable.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the bill.

As a senator from Oklahoma, I have always been committed to protecting the rights of my constituents and ensuring that our government is transparent and accountable.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of the bill. While I understand the concerns expressed by some of my colleagues, such as Senators Kaine, Kelly, and Klobuchar, I believe that this bill strikes a necessary balance between national security and civil liberties. The bill's provisions, including the requirement for prior approval by FBI supervisors or attorneys for U.S. person queries and the prohibition on the involvement of political appointees in the approval process for such queries, provide sufficient safeguards to prevent the abuse of surveillance powers.

I also appreciate the bill's provisions related to the use of information derived from political organizations or media sources, which I believe are adequate to prevent the misuse of such information in FISA applications. Furthermore, I am pleased that the bill increases criminal penalties related to FISA and requires adverse consequences for government officers and employees who engage in intentional misconduct with respect to proceedings before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.

I would like to respond to the comments made by my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the bill.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators King, Lankford, and Lee, have expressed support for the bill and believe that it provides a necessary balance between national security and civil liberties.

As a senator from Alaska, I have always been committed to protecting the rights of my constituents and ensuring that our government is transparent and accountable.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of the bill.

The bill's provisions, including the requirement for prior approval by FBI supervisors or attorneys for U.S. person queries and the prohibition on the involvement of political appointees in the approval process for such queries, provide sufficient safeguards to prevent the abuse of surveillance powers.

I also appreciate the bill's provisions related to the use of information derived from political organizations or media sources, which I believe are adequate to prevent the misuse of such information in FISA applications. Furthermore, I am pleased that the bill increases criminal penalties related to FISA and requires adverse consequences for government officers and employees who engage in intentional misconduct with respect to proceedings before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.

In reaction to the comments from Senators Tillis, Tuberville, and Warner, I would say that I appreciate their thoughtful consideration of the bill. However, I believe that their support for the bill is misguided, and that we must do more to protect the rights of American citizens.

I believe that this bill does not provide a reasonable balance between national security and civil liberties, and I am willing to work with my colleagues to address their concerns and find common ground on this important issue. We must ensure that our government is transparent and accountable, and that we are protecting the rights of all Americans, regardless of where they live.
