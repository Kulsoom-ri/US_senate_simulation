Tammy Baldwin: The bill before us today is a crucial step towards ensuring that our nation's Social Security system is fair and equitable for all Americans. As a long-time advocate for the rights of seniors and vulnerable populations, I am proud to support this legislation.

The government pension offset and windfall elimination provision have long been a source of frustration and financial hardship for many individuals who have dedicated their lives to public service. These provisions have unfairly reduced the Social Security benefits of spouses, widows, and widowers who have also received government pensions, as well as individuals who have received pensions or disability benefits from employers that did not withhold Social Security taxes.

By repealing these provisions, we can help ensure that these individuals receive the full Social Security benefits they have earned and deserve. This is not only a matter of fairness, but also a matter of economic security. Many of these individuals rely on their Social Security benefits as a primary source of income, and the reduction of these benefits can have a significant impact on their ability to make ends meet.

I am pleased to see that this bill has received bipartisan support, with 330 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. This demonstrates that we can put aside our differences and work together to address the pressing issues facing our nation.

As we consider this bill, I want to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Garret Graves, who introduced this legislation, and all of the cosponsors who have worked tirelessly to bring it to the floor.

In light of the previous votes on amendments and the motion to waive budgetary discipline, I believe that we have thoroughly considered the implications of this bill and have made necessary adjustments to ensure its passage.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, which will help to ensure that our Social Security system is fair, equitable, and provides the economic security that our nation's seniors and vulnerable populations deserve.

As for the previous amendments that were not agreed to, I believe that they were not necessary to the core purpose of the bill, and in some cases, would have undermined the intent of the legislation. I am glad that we were able to move forward with the bill without these amendments.

Now, I would like to hear from my colleagues and engage in a thoughtful discussion about the merits of this bill. I am confident that, together, we can pass this important legislation and make a positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans.

Rand Paul: The bill before us today aims to repeal provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for individuals who receive other benefits, such as a pension from a state or local government. As a senator who has always advocated for fiscal responsibility, I must consider the potential costs and implications of such a repeal.

While I understand the frustration that many individuals have experienced due to the government pension offset and windfall elimination provision, I also believe that we must be mindful of the financial burden that repealing these provisions could place on our Social Security system.
