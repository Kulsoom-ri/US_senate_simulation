Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, introduced by Senator Lummis, seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the listing of endangered and threatened species and the designation of critical habitats. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always been committed to protecting our environment and preserving the natural beauty of our country for future generations.

After careful consideration, I must express my strong opposition to this joint resolution. The 2022 rule, which this resolution aims to nullify, is a crucial step forward in our efforts to protect endangered species and their habitats. By rescinding the earlier rule that limited the ability of the National Marine Fisheries Service to designate critical habitats, we can ensure that these areas are protected from human activities that could harm the species that depend on them.

I am concerned that nullifying this rule would undermine our progress in conservation and put the very existence of many species at risk. It is our responsibility as stewards of the environment to take action to protect these species and their habitats, and I believe that this rule is an important step in that direction.

Furthermore, I am disappointed that this resolution has been brought to the floor without adequate consideration of the potential consequences of nullifying this rule. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works was discharged by petition, bypassing the normal committee process and limiting our opportunity for thorough debate and discussion.

In light of these concerns, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work towards finding solutions that balance our economic and environmental interests while protecting the integrity of our conservation efforts.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what is the urgency behind nullifying this rule, and what are the potential consequences for our environment and the species that depend on these critical habitats? I hope that we can have a thoughtful and informed discussion about these issues before making a decision that could have far-reaching impacts on our conservation efforts.

John Barrasso: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must say that I strongly support the effort to nullify the final rule issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service. As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our economy and our way of life. The 2022 rule, which this resolution aims to nullify, is a prime example of the kind of regulatory overreach that can have devastating consequences for our communities.

The rule in question would allow the National Marine Fisheries Service to designate vast areas of land and water as critical habitats, without adequate consideration for the economic and social impacts on local communities. This could lead to significant restrictions on land use, energy development, and other economic activities, which would be disastrous for my state and many others.

I understand that Senator Baldwin and others may have concerns about the potential impact on endangered species, but I believe that we can protect these species without resorting to such drastic and sweeping regulations. We need to find a balance between our environmental and economic interests, and this rule does not achieve that balance.

I also take issue with Senator Baldwin's suggestion that this resolution has been brought to the floor without adequate consideration. The fact is that this rule was issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service without sufficient input from stakeholders, and it is our duty as senators to review and correct such actions when necessary.

As for the urgency behind nullifying this rule, I would say that it is essential that we act quickly to prevent the kind of regulatory overreach that could have long-term consequences for our economy and our environment. We cannot afford to wait and see the damage that this rule could cause, and I believe that it is our responsibility to take action to protect the interests of our constituents.

I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure. We must stand up for the rights of our states and our communities, and we must ensure that our regulatory system is fair, balanced, and effective.

Michael F. Bennet: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must say that I have significant concerns about the potential impact on our environment and the species that depend on these critical habitats.

As a senator from Colorado, I have seen the importance of protecting our natural resources and preserving the beauty of our state for future generations. The 2022 rule, which this resolution aims to nullify, is a crucial step forward in our efforts to protect endangered species and their habitats. By rescinding the earlier rule that limited the ability of the National Marine Fisheries Service to designate critical habitats, we can ensure that these areas are protected from human activities that could harm the species that depend on them.

I share Senator Baldwin's concerns about the potential consequences of nullifying this rule. I believe that we must take a thoughtful and informed approach to conservation, and that we should not rush to undo the progress that we have made. I also agree that the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works was discharged by petition, bypassing the normal committee process and limiting our opportunity for thorough debate and discussion.

However, I also understand the concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule, and I believe that we must find a balance between our environmental and economic interests. As Senator Barrasso noted, we cannot afford to ignore the potential consequences of this rule on local communities and economies.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against this joint resolution. I believe that we should work towards finding solutions that balance our economic and environmental interests, rather than rushing to nullify this rule. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work towards finding a more thoughtful and informed approach to conservation.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what are the potential consequences for our environment and the species that depend on these critical habitats if we nullify this rule? How will we ensure that we are protecting these species and their habitats, while also balancing our economic interests? I hope that we can have a more nuanced and informed discussion about these issues before making a decision that could have far-reaching impacts on our conservation efforts.

The lowest-lying state in the union, Delaware is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and the loss of critical habitats. I firmly believe that we must take a thoughtful and informed approach to conservation, and that we should not rush to undo the progress that we have made.

I share the concerns of Senators Cantwell, Brown, Blumenthal, and Booker about the potential consequences of nullifying this rule.

Robert P. Casey Jr.: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must say that I strongly oppose the effort to nullify the final rule issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the listing of endangered and threatened species and the designation of critical habitats.

Tammy Duckworth: I strongly oppose this joint resolution to nullify the final rule issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the listing of endangered and threatened species and the designation of critical habitats. As a senator from Illinois and the chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Fisheries, Water and Wildlife, I believe that this rule is essential to protecting our nation's most vulnerable species and their habitats.

The 2022 rule, which this resolution aims to nullify, is a crucial step forward in our efforts to conserve and protect endangered species. By allowing the National Marine Fisheries Service to designate critical habitats, we can ensure that these species have the necessary space and resources to thrive. I understand that some of my colleagues have concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule, but I believe that we can balance our economic and environmental interests without sacrificing the well-being of our planet.

I am disappointed, but not surprised, to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle prioritizing the interests of special interests and corporations over the health of our planet. We have a responsibility to protect our natural resources and preserve the beauty of our country for future generations. Nullifying this rule would be a step backwards in our efforts to conserve and protect endangered species, and I will not support it.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what is the alternative to protecting endangered species and their habitats? How will we ensure that we are preserving the natural beauty and biodiversity of our country if we do not take action to protect these species?

By allowing the National Marine Fisheries Service to designate vast areas of land and water as critical habitats without adequate consideration for the economic and social impacts on local communities, this rule could lead to significant restrictions on land use, energy development, and other economic activities. I understand that some of my colleagues have concerns about the potential impact on endangered species, but I believe that we can protect these species without resorting to such drastic and sweeping regulations.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Cruz and Daines, who have highlighted the importance of balancing our environmental and economic interests.

In response to my colleagues, Senators Duckworth and Durbin, who have expressed concerns about the potential impact of this rule on the environment and the species that depend on these critical habitats, I would like to say that I understand and respect their concerns.

I also believe that we must consider the long-term benefits of preserving our natural resources and protecting endangered species.

Bernard Sanders: The joint resolution before us today is a clear example of the Republican Party's ongoing efforts to undermine our nation's environmental protections and prioritize the interests of corporate America over the well-being of our planet. The final rule issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service is a crucial step towards preserving the biodiversity of our country and ensuring the long-term health and prosperity of our economy.

I strongly disagree with my colleagues, Senators Risch, Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, who claim that this rule will stifle economic growth and place undue burdens on farmers, ranchers, and small business owners. The reality is that this rule is a necessary measure to protect our endangered species and their habitats, and it will have a negligible impact on the economy.

In fact, studies have shown that environmental regulations like this one can actually create jobs and stimulate economic growth in the long run. Furthermore, the cost of inaction far outweighs any potential economic costs associated with this rule. If we fail to protect our endangered species and their habitats, we will be leaving future generations with a devastated planet and a crippled economy.

I also take issue with the argument that we need to balance our environmental and economic interests. This is a false dichotomy. We can and must protect our environment while also promoting economic growth. In fact, many of the most successful economies in the world are also the ones that have made the greatest strides in environmental protection.

I will be voting "no" on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure. We must prioritize the protection of our natural resources and preserve the beauty of our country for future generations.

To my colleagues who are supporting this joint resolution, I say: let us not be swayed by the special interests and corporate lobbyists who are driving this effort. Let us stand up for the American people and for the future of our planet. Let us reject this joint resolution and work towards a more thoughtful and informed approach to conservation, one that prioritizes the protection of our environment and the well-being of all Americans.

I believe that the cost of inaction far outweighs any potential economic costs associated with this rule.

As a nation, we have a responsibility to protect our natural resources and preserve the beauty of our country for future generations. Nullifying this rule would be a step backwards in our efforts to conserve and protect endangered species, and I will not support it.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville, and I'm here to share my thoughts on this joint resolution. As a Christian conservative, I believe in being a good steward of the environment, but I also believe in being a good steward of our economy. We can't just focus on one or the other; we have to find a balance.

Now, I've heard my colleagues talk about the importance of considering the economic impacts of this rule, and I agree with them. We can't just impose regulations without thinking about how they'll affect our farmers, ranchers, and small business owners. That's not how we create jobs and grow our economy.

At the same time, I understand the concerns about endangered species. As a nation, we have a responsibility to protect our environment and ensure the long-term health and prosperity of our economy. But we have to do it in a way that makes sense, that's fair and balanced.

After careful consideration, I've decided to vote in favor of this joint resolution. I believe that nullifying this rule will help us take a more balanced approach to conservation, one that considers the needs of both our environment and our economy. We can protect our natural resources and preserve the beauty of our country for future generations without placing undue burdens on our farmers, ranchers, and small business owners.

I appreciate the comments from my colleagues, Senators Sullivan, Tester, Thune, and Tillis. They've all made some great points about the importance of finding a balance between our environmental and economic interests. And I agree with them, we need to take a more thoughtful and informed approach to conservation.

So, I'll be voting "yes" on this joint resolution. I believe it's the right decision for our country, for our economy, and for our environment. We can do better, and we will do better, by finding a balance that works for everyone.

Or do we want to leave them a world that is degraded, polluted, and devoid of the natural wonders that make our country so great?

The choice is clear, and I will continue to fight tirelessly to protect our environment and preserve the natural beauty of our country. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this joint resolution and to stand with me in our commitment to protecting our planet.

Roger F. Wicker: I rise today to express my strong support for this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the final rule issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service. As a senator from Mississippi, I have seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our economy and our way of life.

We must not forget that our actions have consequences, and that we must consider the potential impacts of our decisions on our economy and our communities. Let us work together to find a balance between environmental protection and economic growth, and to ensure that our regulations are effective and do not harm our economy.

I would like to respond to some of my colleagues who have spoken out against this resolution. Senator Warren, I understand your concerns about the potential consequences of nullifying this rule, but I believe that we must consider the economic impacts of this rule and work towards a compromise that balances environmental protection with economic growth. Senator Welch, I appreciate your passion for environmental protection, but I believe that we must also consider the needs of our economy and the potential consequences of overregulation.

In the end, I believe that this resolution is a necessary step towards promoting responsible and effective governance, and I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution.
