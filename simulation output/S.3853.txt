I am particularly pleased to see the provision that requires the Attorney General to issue revised regulations within 180 days of the Act's enactment, taking into account the traditions and customs of Indian tribes. This is a long-overdue recognition of the historical and legal challenges that Native American claimants have faced in providing conventional documentation.

John Fetterman: The proposed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act are a crucial step towards providing justice and compensation to those who have been affected by radiation exposure. As a senator from Pennsylvania, I've seen the devastating effects of radiation exposure on individuals and communities, and I believe that this legislation is a moral obligation we must fulfill.

I'm pleased to see the provision that allows affidavits as acceptable evidence to establish employment history, physical presence in affected areas, and participation in nuclear tests. This adjustment will help address the difficulties that claimants may face in obtaining traditional documentation, particularly for older claims. I also appreciate the provision that requires the Attorney General to issue revised regulations within 180 days of the Act's enactment, taking into account the traditions and customs of Indian tribes. This is a long-overdue recognition of the historical and legal challenges that Native American claimants have faced in providing conventional documentation.

The extension of the filing period for claims from two years to five years and the opportunity for claimants to resubmit their claims up to three times are also significant improvements. Additionally, the mechanism for individuals who already received compensation under RECA to request additional benefits and compensation if the revised law entitles them to a higher amount is a welcome change.

I also appreciate the establishment of a new grant program to study the epidemiological impacts of uranium mining and milling on non-occupationally exposed individuals. This is a vital step towards understanding and addressing the long-term health effects of radiation exposure.

Raphael G. Warnock: My fellow senators, I rise today to express my strong support for the proposed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. As a senator from Georgia, I have seen the devastating effects of radiation exposure on individuals and communities, and I believe that it is our moral obligation to provide justice and compensation to those who have been affected.

I appreciate the bipartisan support for this legislation, and I believe that it is a testament to the importance of providing justice and compensation to those who have been affected by radiation exposure.

I also appreciate the establishment of a new grant program to study the epidemiological impacts of uranium mining and milling on non-occupationally exposed individuals. This is a vital step towards understanding and addressing the long-term health effects of radiation exposure, and I believe that it will help to inform future policy decisions on this issue.
