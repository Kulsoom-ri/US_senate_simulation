Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, introduced by Senator Ted Cruz, aims to nullify the Department of Energy's final rule on energy conservation standards for consumer furnaces. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have to consider the impact of this rule on my constituents, particularly those in the manufacturing and energy sectors.

While I understand the concerns about the potential costs and burdens of implementing these new standards, I strongly believe that we must prioritize energy efficiency and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which this rule amends, is a crucial tool in our efforts to promote energy conservation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Department of Energy's rule, which sets new energy conservation standards for non-weatherized gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces, is a step in the right direction. These standards will help reduce energy consumption, lower utility bills for consumers, and create jobs in the clean energy sector.

I'm disappointed, but not surprised, that this joint resolution has been introduced to nullify this important rule. It's a clear example of the Republican Party's ongoing efforts to undermine our nation's progress on energy efficiency and climate change.

As a member of the Democratic Party, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this attempt to roll back our nation's commitment to energy efficiency and environmental protection.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what's the alternative? Do we simply ignore the urgent need to address climate change and promote energy efficiency? Do we abandon our responsibility to protect the health and well-being of the American people?

I will not be swayed by arguments that this rule is too burdensome or too costly. The fact is, the benefits of energy efficiency far outweigh the costs. And I will not support any effort to undermine the progress we've made on this critical issue.

So, I will be voting no on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in standing up for the health, well-being, and economic security of the American people.

John Barrasso: The joint resolution before us today is a crucial step in protecting the interests of the American people, particularly those in my home state of Wyoming. As the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have carefully reviewed the Department of Energy's final rule on energy conservation standards for consumer furnaces, and I strongly believe that it is a misguided and overly burdensome regulation.

The rule, which sets new energy conservation standards for non-weatherized gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces, will undoubtedly lead to increased costs for consumers and manufacturers alike. These costs will be passed on to the American people, who are already struggling to make ends meet. Furthermore, this rule will stifle innovation and hinder the development of new technologies that could truly make a difference in reducing our energy consumption.

I understand that my colleague, Senator Baldwin, is concerned about the impact of this rule on the environment and climate change. However, I firmly believe that we can achieve our energy efficiency goals without resorting to draconian regulations that harm our economy and our citizens. Instead, we should be focusing on industry-led solutions that promote innovation and job creation.

As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of overregulation on our energy industry. The Department of Energy's rule will only exacerbate this problem, leading to lost jobs and decreased economic activity. I will not stand idly by while the federal government imposes its will on our state and our people.

In response to Senator Baldwin's question, I would say that the alternative is to work towards common-sense solutions that balance our energy needs with our environmental concerns. We should be promoting policies that encourage innovation, investment, and job creation in the energy sector, rather than relying on heavy-handed regulations that stifle growth and progress.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting the Department of Energy's misguided rule. We owe it to the American people to protect their interests and promote policies that benefit our economy, our environment, and our nation as a whole.

John Kennedy: The Department of Energy's final rule on energy conservation standards for consumer furnaces.  I've given this a lot of thought, and I have to say, I'm not impressed with the rule.  As an all-of-the-above energy advocate, I believe we should be promoting American energy independence, not relying on burdensome regulations that could stifle innovation and economic growth.

Now, I know some of my colleagues, like Senators Kaine and Kelly, think this rule is a step in the right direction.  But I disagree.  I think it's a step in the wrong direction.  We should be focusing on developing all forms of energy, including fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables.  This rule, on the other hand, seems to be pushing us towards a more limited approach.

And let's be real, folks.  The cost of implementing these new standards is going to be significant.  It's going to hurt low-income families, small businesses, and rural communities.  I represent the state of Louisiana, and I can tell you, we can't afford to have our economy stifled by overly burdensome regulations.

So, I'll be voting in favor of this joint resolution.  I think it's necessary to nullify the Department of Energy's final rule and allow for further consideration of the potential costs and benefits of these new standards.  We need to find a solution that balances our commitment to energy efficiency with the needs of our economy.

And to my colleagues who are concerned about the potential costs and burdens of implementing these new standards, I say, I hear you.  I share your concerns.  But to those who think this rule is a necessary step towards protecting the environment, I say, let's not be too hasty.  Let's take a closer look at the potential consequences of this rule and make sure we're not doing more harm than good.

In conclusion, I believe this joint resolution is a necessary step towards protecting the interests of the American people.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.  We must prioritize the health, well-being, and economic security of the American people, and this resolution is a step in the right direction.  I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution.

What's burdensome is the cost of inaction, the cost of continuing to rely on fossil fuels and ignoring the urgent need for clean energy.

We have a moral obligation to act on climate change, and this rule is a step in the right direction. It will drive innovation and investment in clean energy technologies, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth. And let's be clear, this rule is not a radical proposal. It's a common-sense measure that will help us reduce our energy consumption, lower our greenhouse gas emissions, and promote energy efficiency.

I also want to address the claim that this rule will harm low-income families and small businesses.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville, and I'm here to give my thoughts on this joint resolution. As a Christian conservative, I believe in being a good steward of the earth, but I also believe in being a good steward of our economy. This rule, in my opinion, is an overreach by the Department of Energy.

We can do this in a way that promotes American energy independence, reduces our reliance on burdensome regulations, and protects the health, well-being, and economic security of the American people.

And to those who are opposing this resolution, I say: let's have a thoughtful and nuanced discussion about how to achieve our goals without harming our economy. I'm willing to listen to your concerns and work together to find a solution that works for everyone. But I'm not willing to support a rule that I believe will harm our economy and stifle innovation.

So, I'm voting "yes" on this joint resolution. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it, and I look forward to continuing this conversation in the days ahead.

As a senator from North Dakota, I've seen firsthand the impact of burdensome regulations on our economy and our citizens. The Department of Energy's final rule on energy conservation standards for consumer furnaces is a perfect example of federal overreach, and I believe it's essential to nullify it.

I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Coons, Cortez Masto, and Collins, argue that this rule is necessary to reduce our nation's carbon footprint and promote clean energy technologies. However, I strongly disagree. This rule will stifle innovation, harm our economy, and disproportionately affect low-income families and small businesses in North Dakota.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I've carefully reviewed this rule, and I believe that it's a classic case of the federal government trying to dictate how Americans should live their lives. The fact is, the cost of implementing these new standards will far outweigh any potential benefits. This rule will increase energy costs for families and businesses, and it will harm our economy.

I commend my colleagues, Senators Cruz, Cornyn, and Cotton, for their thoughtful comments and their commitment to promoting American energy independence. I believe that we must stand together in opposition to this rule and work towards a solution that prioritizes the needs of our nation and our economy.

In response to my colleagues who have spoken out in support of this rule, I say that I understand their concerns about the potential benefits of these new standards. However, I believe that the costs of implementing these new standards far outweigh the benefits. This rule will harm our economy, stifle innovation, and disproportionately affect low-income families and small businesses.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting "yes" on this joint resolution. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren to take action on energy policy, and this resolution is a necessary step towards promoting American energy independence and reducing our reliance on burdensome regulations. I will be voting "yes" on this joint resolution.

As I look at the comments from my colleagues, I'm reminded of the importance of finding a balance between our commitment to energy efficiency and the needs of our economy. I'm willing to work with my colleagues to find a solution that works for everyone, but I firmly believe that this rule is not the answer. It's time for us to take a stand against federal overreach and promote American energy independence. Let's work together to create a more sustainable future for our nation, one that prioritizes the needs of our economy and our citizens.

Mike Crapo: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of my commitment to promoting American energy independence and reducing our reliance on burdensome regulations.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues, such as Senators Coons, Cortez Masto, and Collins, who argue that this rule is necessary to reduce our nation's carbon footprint and promote clean energy technologies, I believe that this rule will stifle innovation, harm our economy, and disproportionately affect low-income families and small businesses in Idaho.

As a senator from Idaho, I have seen firsthand the importance of affordable energy for our citizens and businesses. This rule will actually increase energy costs for families and businesses in the long run, by imposing unnecessary and costly standards on consumer furnaces. I also believe that the federal government should not be dictating energy efficiency standards for consumer furnaces. This is a matter best left to the states and the free market, where innovation and competition can thrive.
