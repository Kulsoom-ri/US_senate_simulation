Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, introduced by Senator Tommy Tuberville, seeks to nullify the interim final rule issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs that authorizes the VA to provide certain abortion-related care to veterans. As a strong advocate for women's reproductive rights and healthcare, I must express my deep concern and opposition to this resolution.

The rule in question is a crucial step forward in ensuring that our nation's veterans have access to comprehensive healthcare, including reproductive health services. It is our moral obligation to provide our veterans with the care they deserve, and that includes access to abortion services. By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a significant step backward and undermining the health and well-being of our veterans.

I am particularly troubled by the fact that this resolution has been introduced without considering the devastating impact it would have on the lives of our veterans, particularly women veterans. It is unacceptable that we would even consider restricting access to essential healthcare services, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as reproductive health.

As a member of the Senate, I have always been committed to protecting and advancing the rights of women and marginalized communities. I have worked tirelessly to ensure that our healthcare system is equitable, accessible, and comprehensive. This resolution is a direct attack on those values, and I will not stand idly by while we attempt to roll back the progress we have made.

I will be voting against this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this misguided effort. We must prioritize the health, well-being, and dignity of our veterans, and that includes protecting their access to reproductive healthcare services. I will continue to fight for the rights of women and veterans, and I will not support any effort that seeks to undermine their autonomy and agency over their own bodies.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what is the justification for restricting access to abortion services for our nation's veterans? What is the moral or ethical basis for denying our veterans the same rights and freedoms that we afford to other Americans? I hope that we can have a thoughtful and respectful discussion about this issue, but I fear that this resolution is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to impose a partisan ideology on our nation's veterans.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this attack on our veterans' healthcare. We must prioritize the well-being and dignity of those who have served our nation, and that includes protecting their access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare services.

John Barrasso: The joint resolution before us today is a crucial matter that requires careful consideration. As a senator, I have always prioritized the well-being and dignity of our nation's veterans, and I believe that this resolution is a necessary step in ensuring that the Department of Veterans Affairs does not overstep its authority.

The interim final rule issued by the VA, which authorizes the provision of certain abortion-related care to veterans, is a clear example of executive overreach. This rule was implemented without proper congressional input or oversight, and it undermines the long-standing principles of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion services.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senator Baldwin, may disagree with my position on this issue. However, I must respectfully disagree with her characterization of this resolution as an "attack on our veterans' healthcare." The fact is, this resolution is about ensuring that the VA stays within its statutory authority and does not use federal funds to provide abortion services, which are not explicitly authorized by Congress.

As a senator from Wyoming, I have always been committed to protecting the values and principles that are important to my constituents.

To Senator Baldwin, I would say that this resolution is not about imposing a partisan ideology on our nation's veterans, but rather about ensuring that the VA operates within the bounds of its statutory authority. I believe that we can have a thoughtful and respectful discussion about this issue, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We must prioritize the well-being and dignity of our nation's veterans, and that includes ensuring that the VA operates within the bounds of its statutory authority.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote "yes" on this joint resolution. I believe that the VA's decision to provide abortion-related care to veterans is a clear overstep of their authority, and it is our duty to ensure that the VA operates within its statutory limits.

I understand that this is a deeply personal and emotional issue, and I respect the opinions of my colleagues who oppose this resolution. However, I believe that we must consider the moral and ethical implications of providing abortion-related care to veterans, and we must ensure that we are not imposing our own ideological views on our nation's heroes.

To my colleagues who oppose this resolution, I ask: what is the moral or ethical basis for providing abortion-related care to veterans? What is the justification for using taxpayer dollars to fund services that are not authorized by law? I believe that we must consider the long-term consequences of our actions and ensure that we are not imposing our own ideological views on our nation's heroes.

In response to my colleagues, Senators Sinema, Smith, Stabenow, and Tester, who have expressed their opposition to this resolution, I would say that I understand and respect their perspectives. However, I must respectfully disagree with their arguments. I believe that the VA's decision to provide abortion-related care to veterans is not a matter of ensuring access to comprehensive healthcare services, but rather a matter of ensuring that the VA operates within its statutory authority.

I would also like to address the comments made by Senator Sullivan, who supports this resolution. I agree with his concerns about the VA operating within its statutory authority, and I believe that this resolution is a necessary step in ensuring that the VA does not overstep its authority.

In conclusion, I believe that this resolution is a necessary step in ensuring that the VA operates within its authority and respects the principles of federalism and individual choice. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort to ensure that the VA does not overstep its authority and provide services that are not authorized by law. We owe it to our nation's heroes to provide them with the care and support they deserve, but we must also ensure that we are not imposing our own ideological views on them.

As a senator who has always stood for the well-being and dignity of our nation's heroes, I believe that we must prioritize their access to comprehensive healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare.

The rule in question is a critical step forward in ensuring that veterans receive the care they need, including access to abortion-related services. It is not only a matter of dignity and autonomy, but also a matter of basic human rights. Veterans, particularly women veterans, deserve to have control over their own bodies and make their own decisions about their reproductive health.

I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the arguments made by my colleagues who support this resolution. They claim that providing abortion-related care is not essential to comprehensive healthcare, but I strongly disagree. Reproductive healthcare is a fundamental aspect of healthcare, and it is our duty as lawmakers to ensure that all individuals, including veterans, have access to the care they need.

I would like to address the comments made by Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, who argue that we must prioritize the well-being and dignity of the unborn.

I will not be swayed by arguments that seek to deny veterans the right to make their own decisions about their reproductive health. It is not our place as lawmakers to impose our own moral or ethical beliefs on others, particularly when it comes to a matter as personal and intimate as reproductive healthcare.

I will vote "no" on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this effort to restrict access to abortion-related care for our nation's veterans. We owe it to them to defend their right to dignity, autonomy, and comprehensive healthcare, and I will continue to work tirelessly to support this fundamental value.

In response to my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what is the moral or ethical basis for denying veterans the right to make their own decisions about their reproductive health? What is the justification for using our authority as lawmakers to impose our own beliefs on others, particularly when it comes to a matter as personal and intimate as reproductive healthcare?

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville, and I'm proud to be the sponsor of this joint resolution. As a Christian conservative, I believe that life is sacred and should be protected at all stages. The interim final rule issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide certain abortion-related care to veterans is a clear overreach of the Biden administration's authority.

I understand that some of my colleagues may disagree with me on this issue, but I firmly believe that providing abortion-related care is not essential to comprehensive healthcare.

I've listened to the arguments from my colleagues, including Senators Sinema, Smith, Stabenow, and Tester, and I respect their right to hold different views.

I'm glad to see that some of my colleagues, including Senators Sullivan, Thune, and Tillis, share my concerns about the interim final rule and are willing to have a thorough discussion about its implications. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and to engage in a thoughtful and respectful discussion about the importance of protecting the sanctity of life and promoting a culture of life.
