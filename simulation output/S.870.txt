Tammy Baldwin: The bill before us today, introduced by Senator Gary Peters, aims to reauthorize the U.S. Fire Administration, the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program, and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant Program through FY2030. As a senator from Wisconsin, I understand the importance of supporting our nation's firefighters and ensuring they have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.

After careful consideration, I am pleased to announce that I will be voting in favor of this bill. The reauthorization of these programs is crucial for the well-being and safety of our firefighters, as well as the communities they serve. The bill also takes a significant step in addressing the barriers that prevent fire departments from accessing federal funds, which is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

I also appreciate the provision that makes the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs. This is a necessary measure to ensure that our federal funds are not being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security.

While I am supportive of the bill, I do want to acknowledge the amendments that were proposed and voted on earlier. Unfortunately, some of these amendments did not receive the necessary votes to pass, but I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to improve the bill.

In particular, I was disappointed that Amendment SA 85, proposed by Senator Van Hollen, did not pass. This amendment would have provided grants for fire station construction through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is a critical need for many of our fire departments.

Overall, I believe that this bill is a step in the right direction, and I am proud to support it. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this important legislation, which will help to ensure the safety and well-being of our nation's firefighters and the communities they serve.

As a senator from Wyoming, I understand the importance of supporting our nation's firefighters and ensuring they have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.

However, I do have some concerns about the bill. While I agree that the reauthorization of these programs is crucial, I believe that we need to be more mindful of the fiscal implications of this legislation. As a nation, we are already facing significant budget constraints, and I worry that this bill may not be fully offset. I would have liked to see more amendments that addressed this issue, such as Amendment SA 81, which proposed using unspent COVID-19 relief funds to offset the costs of grants.

I also appreciate the provision that makes the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs. This is a necessary measure to ensure that our federal funds are not being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security.

I also appreciate the provision that makes the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs. This is a necessary measure to ensure that our federal funds are not being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Budd, Cantwell, Capito, and Cardin, that this bill is a step in the right direction. While it is not perfect, I believe that it takes a significant step in addressing the barriers that prevent fire departments from accessing federal funds, and it provides critical support to our nation's firefighters.

I do want to acknowledge the amendments that were proposed and voted on earlier. I was disappointed to see that some of them did not receive the necessary votes to pass, particularly Amendment SA 85, which would have provided grants for fire station construction through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I believe that this is a critical need for many of our fire departments, and I hope that we can work together to address this issue in future legislation.

As someone who has been a strong advocate for the safety and well-being of our communities, I believe that this bill is a necessary step in supporting our nation's firefighters and ensuring that they have the resources they need to keep our communities safe. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this important legislation.

Rand Paul: I rise today to express my concerns about the bill before us, which reauthorizes the U.S. Fire Administration, the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program, and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant Program. While I appreciate the bipartisan support this bill has received, I have to say that I'm disappointed, but not surprised, that my colleagues have once again chosen to ignore the issue of fiscal responsibility.

As a senator who has consistently advocated for reducing government spending and balancing our budget, I believe it's essential to consider the financial implications of this bill. We're talking about reauthorizing programs that will cost billions of dollars over the next several years, and yet, we're not having a serious discussion about how we're going to pay for it.

I've proposed amendments to offset the costs of these programs, but unfortunately, they've been rejected. I've also spoken out about the need to reduce our national debt and avoid burdening future generations with unsustainable spending. But it seems like my colleagues are more interested in scoring political points than in taking responsible action.

I do appreciate the provision that makes the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs. This is a necessary measure to ensure our federal funds aren't being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security.

However, I'm concerned that this bill doesn't do enough to address the root causes of the problems facing our fire departments. We need to be looking at ways to reduce the burden of regulations and bureaucracy that prevent fire departments from accessing federal funds. We need to be supporting our first responders in a way that's fiscally responsible and sustainable.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this bill. I believe that it's a step in the wrong direction, and it fails to address the critical issue of fiscal responsibility. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and to work towards finding more responsible solutions to support our nation's firefighters.

My vote is: No.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. Our nation's firefighters deserve our support, and this bill is a critical step in ensuring that they have the resources they need to keep our communities safe. My vote is: Yes.

I appreciate the bipartisan support this bill has received, and I'm pleased to see my colleagues from both sides of the aisle coming together to support our nation's firefighters. The provision that makes the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs is a necessary measure to ensure our federal funds aren't being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security.

I also appreciate the provision that requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct an audit of and issue a publicly available report on the barriers that prevent fire departments from accessing federal funds, as well as the U.S. Fire Administration. This will help us better understand the challenges that our fire departments face and identify ways to improve their access to federal resources.

As a Democrat, I believe in investing in our nation's safety and security, and I believe that this bill is a necessary step in supporting our firefighters. I share the concern of my colleagues about the need for fire station construction grants, and I hope that we can work together to address this issue in future legislation.

I would like to commend my colleagues, including Senators Peters, Welch, Whitehouse, Wicker, Wyden, and Young, for their thoughtful comments and their commitment to supporting our nation's firefighters. I am pleased to see that we are able to come together in a bipartisan manner to support this important legislation, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to address the needs of our firefighters and our communities.

In particular, I would like to acknowledge the comments made by Senators Duckworth, Durbin, Ernst, Fetterman, and Fischer. Their thoughts and insights have been invaluable to this discussion, and I appreciate their dedication to supporting our nation's firefighters.

Cindy Hyde-Smith: As I consider the bill before us today, I must say that I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to support our nation's firefighters. As a senator from Mississippi, I understand the importance of ensuring that our first responders have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.

I agree with my colleagues that the provision making the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs is a necessary measure to ensure our federal funds aren't being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security.

Rand Paul: As I consider the bill before us today, I am reminded of the critical role that our nation's firefighters play in keeping our communities safe.

As a senator from Kentucky and a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility, I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that we are being mindful of our nation's fiscal responsibilities.

While I appreciate the bipartisan support this bill has received, I am disappointed that we are not taking a more comprehensive approach to addressing the needs of our firefighters. The provision that makes the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs is a necessary measure to ensure our federal funds aren't being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security.

However, I am concerned that this bill does not do enough to address the root causes of the challenges faced by our fire departments. The audit required by the Government Accountability Office is a step in the right direction, but I fear that it may not go far enough in identifying ways to improve access to federal resources.

As a Republican, I believe in being fiscally responsible, and I have some concerns about the cost of this bill. I would like to see more offsets and more efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency in our federal spending. I hope that we can work together to address these issues in future legislation.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senator Paul, have expressed concerns about the cost of this bill.

The provision that makes the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs is a necessary measure to ensure our federal funds aren't being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security. I believe this is a common-sense step that will help protect our nation's interests.

The audit required by the Government Accountability Office will help us better understand the challenges that our fire departments face and identify ways to improve their access to federal resources. This will be an important tool in helping us to make informed decisions about how to support our fire departments in the future.

As a senator from Mississippi and a strong advocate for supporting our first responders, I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that we are providing the necessary resources to our fire departments.

I appreciate the bipartisan support this bill has received, and I'm pleased to see my colleagues from both sides of the aisle coming together to support our nation's firefighters. The provision that makes the government of China, and any entity or organization operating or incorporated in China, ineligible to be a recipient or subrecipient of federal assistance under these programs is a necessary measure to ensure our federal funds aren't being used to support entities that may pose a risk to our national security.

I also appreciate the provision that requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct an audit of and issue a publicly available report on the barriers that prevent fire departments from accessing federal funds, as well as the U.S. Fire Administration. This will help us better understand the challenges that our fire departments face and identify ways to improve their access to federal resources.

As a Republican, I believe in investing in our nation's safety and security, and I believe that this bill is a necessary step in supporting our firefighters. I share the concern of my colleagues about the need for fire station construction grants, and I hope that we can work together to address this issue in future legislation.

I would like to respond to Senator Paul's comment about the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing the needs of our firefighters. I agree that we should always be looking for ways to improve our support for our fire departments, and I'm committed to working with Senator Paul and other colleagues to identify areas where we can make improvements.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this important legislation. Our nation's firefighters play a critical role in keeping our communities safe, and it's our responsibility to ensure that they have the resources they need to do their jobs effectively.

My vote is: Yes. I'm proud to support this bill, and I believe it's a crucial step in supporting our nation's firefighters and keeping our communities safe.

I'd like to thank my colleagues, including Senators Warner, Warnock, and others, for their thoughtful comments and their support for this bill. I'm pleased to see that we have bipartisan support for this legislation, and I'm confident that it will pass with overwhelming support.
