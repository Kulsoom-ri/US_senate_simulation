Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today seeks to nullify the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have seen firsthand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities, and I strongly believe that we must ensure that these funds are used effectively to support our state and local governments.

The rule in question modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program. This change is crucial in allowing states and localities to use these funds for authorized purposes, such as reporting, audit, or environmental compliance requirements, by the required deadline of December 31, 2024.

I oppose this joint resolution because it would undermine the ability of our state and local governments to respond to the ongoing needs of their communities. The Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds have been a lifeline for many of our cities and towns, and we must ensure that these funds are used to support economic recovery, improve public health, and address the long-term effects of the pandemic.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this joint resolution is an attempt to undermine the authority of the Department of Treasury to implement the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The Treasury Department has worked tirelessly to provide guidance and support to states and localities, and we must trust in their ability to administer these funds effectively.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, I have had the opportunity to review the rule and its implications. I believe that it is a reasonable and necessary modification to the SLFRF program, and I see no compelling reason to nullify it.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and to instead focus on supporting our state and local governments as they continue to recover from the pandemic.

I would like to ask the sponsor of this resolution, Senator Schmitt, if he can explain why he believes it is necessary to nullify this rule, and how he thinks it will benefit our state and local governments. I would also like to know what alternative solutions he proposes to ensure that these funds are used effectively to support our communities.

John Barrasso: I rise in support of this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen how these funds have been used in my state, and I believe that this rule is an overreach of the Treasury Department's authority.

The rule in question modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program. While I understand the intent behind this change, I believe that it is unnecessary and could lead to further bureaucratic delays in the use of these funds.

I disagree with my colleague, Senator Baldwin, who believes that this rule is crucial in allowing states and localities to use these funds for authorized purposes. I think that this rule is an example of the federal government trying to micromanage how states and localities use these funds, rather than trusting them to make their own decisions.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this rule could lead to more red tape and administrative burdens on states and localities, which could divert resources away from the actual needs of their communities. As someone who has worked in the healthcare industry, I know how important it is to get resources to those who need them quickly and efficiently.

I would like to ask Senator Baldwin, if she believes that this rule is so crucial, why she doesn't trust states and localities to make their own decisions about how to use these funds? Doesn't she think that they are better equipped to understand the needs of their own communities, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all solution from the federal government?

I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, because I believe that it is necessary to nullify this rule and give states and localities the flexibility they need to use these funds effectively. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure, and to trust in the ability of our state and local governments to make their own decisions about how to use these funds.

Michael F. Bennet: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must say that I am inclined to oppose it.

As a senator from Colorado, I have seen firsthand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities, and I believe that we must do everything in our power to support their recovery. The rule in question modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program, which is a crucial change that will allow states and localities to use these funds for authorized purposes, such as reporting, audit, or environmental compliance requirements, by the required deadline of December 31, 2024.

I understand that my colleagues, Senators Baldwin and Barrasso, have differing opinions on this matter. Senator Baldwin has articulated the importance of this rule in allowing states and localities to use these funds effectively, and I agree with her assessment. On the other hand, Senator Barrasso has expressed concerns that this rule is an overreach of the Treasury Department's authority and could lead to further bureaucratic delays.

However, I must respectfully disagree with Senator Barrasso's concerns. I believe that the Treasury Department has worked tirelessly to provide guidance and support to states and localities, and we must trust in their ability to administer these funds effectively. The rule is a reasonable and necessary modification to the SLFRF program, and I see no compelling reason to nullify it.

In fact, I think that nullifying this rule would undermine the ability of our state and local governments to respond to the ongoing needs of their communities. The Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds have been a lifeline for many of our cities and towns, and we must ensure that these funds are used to support economic recovery, improve public health, and address the long-term effects of the pandemic.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and to instead focus on supporting our state and local governments as they continue to recover from the pandemic.

To Senator Schmitt, I would like to ask: what alternative solutions do you propose to ensure that these funds are used effectively to support our communities, and how do you think nullifying this rule will benefit our state and local governments? I would also like to know how you plan to address the concerns of states and localities that have already begun to use these funds in accordance with the Treasury Department's rule.

As a senator from West Virginia, I have seen firsthand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities, and I believe that we must trust our state and local governments to make their own decisions about how to use these funds. The rule in question modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program, which I believe is unnecessary and could lead to further bureaucratic delays.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Barrasso, Blackburn, Boozman, Braun, Britt, and Budd, that this rule is an example of the federal government trying to dictate how states and localities use these funds, rather than trusting them to make their own decisions. I also share their concern that this rule could lead to more bureaucratic delays and divert resources away from the actual needs of our communities.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Brown, Butler, and Cantwell, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of nullifying this rule. However, I believe that the benefits of giving states and localities more flexibility in using these funds outweigh the potential risks. I am confident that our state and local governments are capable of making their own decisions about how to use these funds, and I trust that they will use them effectively to support their communities.

To Senator Schmitt, I would like to say that I appreciate his leadership on this issue and his commitment to reducing the federal government's overreach. I believe that his proposal to nullify this rule is a step in the right direction, and I look forward to working with him to find alternative solutions that will support our state and local governments as they continue to recover from the pandemic.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. As a conservative, I believe that it is our duty to support our communities and to trust in the ability of our state and local governments to make their own decisions. I am committed to reducing the federal government's overreach and to giving states and localities the flexibility they need to thrive.

I believe that the rule is an overreach of the federal government's authority, and that nullifying it will give states and localities the flexibility they need to use these funds effectively. I would like to ask her to consider the potential consequences of allowing the federal government to continue to micromanage the use of these funds, and how it may impact the ability of our state and local governments to respond to the ongoing needs of their communities.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. As a conservative, I believe that it is our duty to support our communities and to trust in the ability of our state and local governments to make their own decisions. I am committed to reducing the federal government's overreach and to giving states and localities the flexibility they need to thrive.

Steve Daines: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must say that I am inclined to vote in favor of it.

As a senator from Montana, I have seen firsthand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities, and I believe that we must trust our state and local governments to make their own decisions about how to use these funds. The rule in question modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program, which I believe is unnecessary and could lead to further bureaucratic delays.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Barrasso, Blackburn, Boozman, Braun, Britt, Budd, Cornyn, Cotton, and Cramer, that this rule is an example of the federal government trying to dictate how states and localities use these funds, rather than trusting them to make their own decisions. I also share their concern that this rule could lead to more bureaucratic delays and divert resources away from the actual needs of our communities.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Coons, Cortez Masto, and Collins, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of nullifying this rule.

Tammy Duckworth: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds.

Furthermore, I am concerned that nullifying this rule could lead to confusion and uncertainty among state and local governments, and could potentially divert resources away from the actual needs of our communities. I believe that we must trust the expertise of the Treasury Department and the other federal agencies that have worked to develop this rule, and that we must give them the flexibility to implement it effectively.

To my colleagues who have expressed support for this joint resolution, I would like to ask: what is the alternative?

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure.

Mazie K. Hirono: I rise today to express my strong opposition to the joint resolution before us, which nullifies the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. As a senator from Hawaii, I have seen firsthand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities, and I believe that we must ensure these funds are used effectively and efficiently to support our state and local governments.

The rule in question modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program, which I believe is a necessary step to ensure these funds are used for their intended purpose and that states and localities are held accountable for their use.

I disagree with my colleagues, Senators Grassley and Hagerty, who argue that this rule is an example of federal overreach. I believe the federal government has a critical role to play in ensuring these funds are used to support our communities, and this rule is a necessary step to achieve that goal.

Nullifying this rule could lead to confusion and uncertainty among state and local governments, potentially diverting resources away from the actual needs of our communities. I believe we must trust the expertise of the Treasury Department and other federal agencies that developed this rule and give them the flexibility to implement it effectively.

To my colleagues who have expressed support for this joint resolution, I ask: what's the alternative? How do you propose we ensure these funds are used effectively and efficiently without some level of federal oversight and guidance? I believe we must work together to find solutions that support our state and local governments, rather than simply nullifying rules without considering the potential consequences.

John Hoeven: As I consider the joint resolution before us, I must say that I strongly support nullifying the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. As a senator from North Dakota, I have seen firsthand the impact of federal overreach on our state and local governments. This rule, in my opinion, is a prime example of the federal government exceeding its authority and imposing unnecessary burdens on our communities.

I understand that my colleagues, Senators Hassan, Heinrich, Hickenlooper, and Hirono, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of nullifying this rule. However, I must respectfully disagree with their assessment. I believe that the federal government should not be dictating how our state and local governments use these funds. Instead, we should be giving them the flexibility to respond to the unique needs of their communities.

The rule in question modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program. While I understand the intention behind this rule, I believe it is an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy that will only serve to slow down the distribution of these funds. Our state and local governments are capable of managing these funds effectively without the need for federal oversight.

I also take issue with the argument that nullifying this rule will lead to confusion and uncertainty among state and local governments. I believe that our communities are resilient and adaptable, and they will be able to navigate any changes that come with nullifying this rule.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution. I believe that it is essential to nullify this rule and give our state and local governments the freedom to use these funds as they see fit. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure and trusting the expertise of our state and local governments to manage these funds effectively.

To my colleagues who have expressed opposition to this joint resolution, I ask: don't you trust the ability of our state and local governments to manage these funds? Don't you believe that they are better equipped to respond to the unique needs of their communities than the federal government? I believe that we should be giving them the flexibility to do so, rather than imposing unnecessary federal oversight.

I will be voting yes on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure.

Angus S. King Jr.: The joint resolution before us today seeks to nullify the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. As an independent senator from Maine, I have carefully considered the arguments presented by my colleagues, and I must say that I am inclined to oppose this joint resolution.

Sheldon Whitehouse: I rise today to express my strong opposition to the joint resolution before us, which seeks to nullify the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. As a senator from Rhode Island, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities, and I believe that we must ensure these funds are used effectively and efficiently to support our state and local governments.

The rule in question modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program. I believe that this is a necessary step to ensure that these funds are used responsibly and in a way that benefits our communities.

Roger F. Wicker: I rise today to express my strong support for the joint resolution before us, which seeks to nullify the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. As a senator from Mississippi, I have seen firsthand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities, and I believe that we must ensure these funds are used effectively and efficiently to support our state and local governments.

However, I believe that this rule is a classic example of federal overreach, and that we must take a stand against it.

By nullifying this rule, we can ensure that state and local governments have the flexibility to use these funds in a way that is tailored to their unique needs, rather than being forced to follow a rigid framework imposed by the federal government.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of nullifying this rule, I would say that I understand their concerns, but I believe that this rule is a necessary step to ensure that these funds are used responsibly. However, I would argue that the federal government should not be dictating how these funds are used, but rather giving state and local governments the flexibility to use them in a way that benefits their communities.

I will be voting yes on this joint resolution, as I believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step to ensure that these funds are used effectively and efficiently to support our state and local governments.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and keeping this rule in place to ensure that state and local governments are held accountable for their use of these funds.

I will do everything in my power to support our state and local governments and ensure that they have the resources they need to respond to the pandemic. I will be voting no on this joint resolution.

Todd Young: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must say that I agree with my colleagues, Senators Schmitt, Rubio, and Scott, who believe that nullifying the Department of Treasury's rule related to the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds is a necessary step to prevent federal overreach.

As a senator from Indiana, I've seen the impact of the pandemic on our communities, and I believe that this rule is an example of federal overreach. The rule modifies the definition of an obligation to include satisfaction of administrative or legal requirements associated with the SLFRF program, which I believe is an unnecessary burden on our state and local governments.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Warren, Welch, Whitehouse, and Wyden, have expressed concerns about the importance of this rule in preventing waste, fraud, and abuse. However, I think it's essential to strike a balance between giving our state and local governments the flexibility they need to respond to the pandemic and ensuring that these funds are used for their intended purpose.

I'd like to respond to Senator Warren, who said that this rule is a necessary step to ensure that these funds are used responsibly. While I understand her point, I believe that this rule is an example of federal overreach and that nullifying it is a necessary step to ensure that our state and local governments have the flexibility they need to respond to the pandemic.

As someone who has worked tirelessly to advocate for the rights and needs of my constituents, I believe that this rule is a hindrance to our state and local governments' ability to effectively respond to the pandemic. We must prioritize flexibility, accountability, and responsible use of taxpayer dollars, especially during times of crisis.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that nullifying this rule is a necessary step to ensure that the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds are used effectively and efficiently by our state and local governments. I will be voting yes on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and giving our state and local governments the flexibility they need to respond to the pandemic.

I will do everything in my power to support our state and local governments and ensure that they have the resources they need to respond to the pandemic. I will be voting yes on this joint resolution.
