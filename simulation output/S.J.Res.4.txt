Tammy Baldwin: The Equal Rights Amendment. A long-overdue recognition of the fundamental equality of all individuals, regardless of sex. As a proud supporter of women's rights and a champion of social justice, I am eager to move forward with this joint resolution.

The fact that the Equal Rights Amendment was originally proposed over 50 years ago is a stark reminder of the glacial pace of progress in our country. Despite the tireless efforts of advocates and activists, we still have not enshrined the principle of equal rights for all in our Constitution. It's time for us to rectify this injustice.

The argument that the deadlines for ratification have expired is a technicality that should not stand in the way of justice. The fact that 38 states have ratified the amendment, despite the deadlines, demonstrates the broad support for this fundamental principle. We should not let bureaucratic hurdles deny the rights of millions of Americans.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I am proud to represent a state with a strong tradition of progressive values and a commitment to social justice. My constituents expect me to stand up for what is right, even in the face of opposition. And I will not disappoint them.

I will vote in favor of cloture on the motion to proceed. It's time for us to take a crucial step towards a more just and equitable society. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and moving forward with the consideration of the Equal Rights Amendment.

To my colleagues who may be hesitant or opposed to this resolution, I say: this is not a partisan issue, but a matter of basic human dignity. The Equal Rights Amendment is not a threat to anyone's rights, but rather a guarantee of equal protection under the law for all Americans. Let us work together to make this vision a reality.

I am ready to move forward with this resolution and make history. Let us seize this moment and ensure that the Equal Rights Amendment becomes a part of our Constitution, where it rightfully belongs.

John Barrasso: I rise today to express my strong opposition to the joint resolution regarding the Equal Rights Amendment. While I understand the sentiment behind this amendment, I believe that the process by which it is being considered is flawed and ignores the clear deadlines that were established for its ratification.

The original proposal for the Equal Rights Amendment included a deadline for ratification of March 22, 1979, which was later extended to June 30, 1982. Despite these deadlines, three states ratified the amendment after they had expired, and five states subsequently rescinded their ratifications. This raises serious questions about the validity of the amendment's ratification.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this joint resolution ignores the will of the states that have rescinded their ratifications. The Constitution is clear that amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the states, and it is not for Congress to unilaterally declare an amendment ratified despite the objections of some states.

I also take issue with the argument that the deadlines for ratification are merely a technicality. The deadlines were established for a reason, and they are an integral part of the constitutional amendment process. Ignoring these deadlines sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the integrity of the Constitution.

As a senator from Wyoming, I am committed to upholding the principles of federalism and respecting the rights of states to make their own decisions. I believe that this joint resolution is an overreach of federal power and ignores the concerns of states that have objections to the Equal Rights Amendment.

I will vote against cloture on the motion to proceed, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. This is not a matter of being opposed to equal rights, but rather a matter of respecting the Constitution and the process by which it is amended.

To my colleague, Senator Baldwin, I say that while I understand your passion for this issue, I must respectfully disagree with your characterization of this as a matter of basic human dignity. The Constitution is a sacred document that must be treated with respect and care, and we must not ignore its provisions or the will of the states in our zeal to advance a particular agenda.

I am willing to work with my colleagues to find alternative solutions to address the issues of equal rights, but I will not support a joint resolution that ignores the Constitution and the rights of states.

Michael F. Bennet: As I stand here today, I am reminded of the long and arduous journey that the Equal Rights Amendment has taken to get to this point. Originally proposed over 50 years ago, it is a stark reminder of the glacial pace of progress in our country. Despite the tireless efforts of advocates and activists, we still have not enshrined the principle of equal rights for all in our Constitution.

I understand the concerns raised by my colleague, Senator Barrasso, regarding the deadlines for ratification and the process by which this amendment is being considered. However, I firmly believe that the argument that the deadlines for ratification have expired is a technicality that should not stand in the way of justice.

As a senator from Colorado, I am committed to upholding the principles of equality and justice. I believe that the Equal Rights Amendment is a crucial step towards a more just and equitable society.

Therefore, I will vote in favor of cloture on the motion to proceed.

Marsha Blackburn: The Equal Rights Amendment. A proposal that has been debated for decades, and one that I have given considerable thought to. As a senator from Tennessee, I must consider the views of my constituents, as well as the principles of our great nation.

While I understand the sentiment behind the Equal Rights Amendment, I must express my concerns about the process by which it is being considered. The original proposal included a deadline for ratification, which has long since expired. Furthermore, several states have rescinded their ratifications, raising questions about the validity of the amendment's ratification.

I agree with Senator Barrasso that ignoring these deadlines sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the integrity of the Constitution.

As a conservative, I believe in upholding the principles of federalism and respecting the rights of states to make their own decisions.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, and Cantwell, that this is not a partisan issue, but a matter of basic human dignity. The Equal Rights Amendment is not a threat to anyone's rights, but rather a guarantee of equal protection under the law for all Americans.

They're talking about technicalities and deadlines, but let's be real, this is about equality and justice for all Americans, regardless of sex.

We're not just talking about women's rights; we're talking about the fundamental principle that everyone deserves to be treated equally under the law.

Marsha Blackburn: I rise today to express my strong opposition to the joint resolution to recognize the Equal Rights Amendment as a valid constitutional amendment. As a senator from Tennessee, I have always been a strong advocate for the principles of federalism and the rule of law. I firmly believe that this amendment's ratification process has been flawed from the start.

While I understand the importance of equality and justice for all Americans, I also believe that we must respect the Constitution's amendment process and the will of the American people as expressed through their elected representatives. The fact that some states ratified the amendment after the deadlines and that five states subsequently rescinded their ratifications raises serious concerns about the validity of the ratification process.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Wicker, Young, and Barrasso, who have raised concerns about the technicalities of the ratification process. We cannot simply disregard the deadlines and procedural requirements that were established for the amendment's ratification. To do so would be to undermine the rule of law and the principles of federalism that our nation was founded upon.

I am concerned that recognizing the ERA as a valid constitutional amendment could have unintended consequences that could harm the very people it is intended to help. As a senator, I have a duty to uphold the Constitution and to ensure that any changes to it are made in a manner that is consistent with the will of the American people and the principles of federalism.

The ERA is a fundamental issue of human rights that has been long overdue for recognition as a valid constitutional amendment. It is a matter of simple fairness and equality, and it is essential that we take this crucial step towards creating a more just and equal society.

I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the ratification process, and I respect their perspectives. However, I firmly believe that we cannot let procedural issues stand in the way of progress. The fact that some states ratified the amendment after the deadlines and that five states subsequently rescinded their ratifications does not diminish the overwhelming support for the ERA.

As a senator who has a strong record of supporting progressive values, I believe that it's our responsibility to approach this issue with care and consideration, but also with a sense of urgency and determination. We owe it to the women and girls of America, and to the generations that have fought for this moment, to ensure that the ERA becomes a reality.

I commend my colleagues, including Senators Hirono, Kaine, Kelly, King, Klobuchar, and Lujan, for their passionate and thoughtful remarks on this issue. They are absolutely right that the ERA is not a partisan issue, but a matter of fundamental human rights.

To my colleagues who are hesitant to move forward, I say: let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Let's take a step towards equality and justice, and let's work together to find a solution that upholds the principles of equality and justice while also respecting the constitutional process. We can do this, and we must do this. The women and girls of America are counting on us.

In conclusion, I will vote yes on cloture, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution. Let us make history today, and let us create a brighter future for all Americans. The women and girls of America are counting on us, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues in supporting the Equal Rights Amendment.

I am proud to be a part of this effort to recognize the Equal Rights Amendment as a valid constitutional amendment, and I am committed to working with my colleagues to find a solution that upholds the principles of equality and justice while also respecting the constitutional process. Let us work together to create a more just and equal society for all Americans.

Peter Welch: The Equal Rights Amendment. A matter of great importance, indeed. As I consider the joint resolution to recognize the ERA as a valid constitutional amendment, I am reminded of the long history of struggle for equality and justice in our country. As a senator from Vermont, I've seen firsthand the impact of sexism and misogyny on women's lives, and I believe that the ERA is a necessary step towards addressing these injustices and ensuring that women are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

I understand that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about the ratification process, and I respect their commitment to upholding the Constitution.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Van Hollen, Shaheen, Sinema, Smith, Stabenow, and Tester, that we cannot let procedural issues stand in the way of progress.

To my colleagues who have expressed opposition to the ERA, I would say that I respect their commitment to upholding the Constitution, but I believe that we must not let our desire to respect the constitutional process cloud our judgment and lead us to disregard the principles of equality and justice. We must find a solution that upholds the principles of equality and justice while also respecting the constitutional process.

In response to Senator Vance, who stated that we must prioritize the integrity of our constitutional process over the desire to achieve a particular policy outcome, I would say that while I understand his concerns, I believe that the ERA is too important to be delayed or rejected due to procedural technicalities. We must prioritize the principles of equality and justice, and we must take a step towards creating a more just and equal society.

I would like to address the comments made by Senators Thune, Tillis, Tuberville, and Vance, who have raised concerns about the ratification process.

Let us not forget the countless women and girls who have been marginalized, oppressed, and silenced throughout our nation's history. Let us not forget the struggles of the suffragettes, who fought tirelessly for the right to vote. Let us not forget the brave women who have come forward to share their stories of harassment, abuse, and discrimination.

We owe it to them, and to ourselves, to take this crucial step towards creating a more just and equal society. We owe it to them to recognize the Equal Rights Amendment as a valid constitutional amendment, and to enshrine the principles of equality and justice in our nation's founding document.

Roger F. Wicker: I rise today to express my opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment. As a senator from Mississippi, I have always been committed to upholding the Constitution and respecting the rules that govern our constitutional process. While I understand the importance of equality and justice, I believe that we must not let our desire to achieve a particular policy outcome cloud our judgment and lead us to disregard the principles of constitutional integrity.

The ratification process for the ERA has been flawed from the start. The original proposal included a deadline for ratification, which was subsequently extended. However, several states ratified the amendment after the deadlines, and five states even rescinded their ratifications. This raises serious questions about the validity of the ratification process and whether the ERA has truly met the constitutional requirements for becoming a part of our nation's founding document.

I respect the passion and commitment of my colleagues who support the ERA, but I believe that we must prioritize the integrity of our constitutional process over the desire to achieve a particular policy outcome. We must ensure that any changes to our Constitution are made in a manner that is consistent with the principles of democracy and the rule of law.

I will vote no on cloture, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this joint resolution. We must take a step back and carefully consider the implications of recognizing the ERA as a valid constitutional amendment, rather than rushing forward with a flawed and potentially unconstitutional process.

I would like to address the comments made by my colleagues, Senators Warnock, Warren, Welch, and Whitehouse, who have argued that the ERA is a matter of fundamental human rights and that we must not let procedural technicalities stand in the way of progress. I understand their commitment to equality and justice, but I believe that we must balance our desire to achieve these goals with our responsibility to uphold the Constitution and respect the rules that govern our constitutional process.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to prioritize the integrity of our constitutional process and to vote no on cloture. Let us take a step back and carefully consider the implications of recognizing the ERA as a valid constitutional amendment, rather than rushing forward with a flawed and potentially unconstitutional process.
