Let us work towards a common goal: fairness, justice, and dignity for our nation's public servants. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and voting yes on cloture.

Todd Young: As I consider the bill before us today, I am reminded of the importance of fairness and justice for our nation's public servants. The government pension offset and windfall elimination provision have unfairly penalized many of our nation's public servants, including teachers, firefighters, and police officers, who have dedicated their lives to serving our communities. It is our duty as lawmakers to ensure that they are not unfairly penalized for their service.

I agree with my colleagues, including Senators Warnock, Warren, Welch, Whitehouse, Wicker, and Wyden, that this is not a partisan issue, but a matter of basic fairness and justice. The fact that this bill has garnered 330 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle is a testament to the bipartisan support for this legislation.

As a Republican, I have always believed in fighting for the rights of working-class Americans, including our nation's public servants. I believe that the benefits of repealing these provisions far outweigh the potential costs, and I am willing to work with my colleagues to address any concerns and find a solution that is fiscally responsible and fair to all Americans.

I would like to commend my colleagues for their thoughtful comments and their commitment to supporting our nation's public servants. I am proud to see that we can put aside our differences and work towards a common goal: fairness, justice, and dignity for our nation's public servants.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of cloture on the motion to proceed. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and putting aside our differences to work towards a common goal. Yes, I will be voting yes on cloture.

In response to my colleagues' comments, I would like to say that I appreciate the thoughtful remarks from Senators Warnock, Warren, Welch, Whitehouse, Wicker, and Wyden. I agree that this legislation is a critical step towards ensuring that our nation's public servants are treated fairly and with the dignity they deserve. I also appreciate the emphasis on finding common ground and promoting bipartisanship.

Let us come together to support our nation's public servants and ensure that they are not unfairly penalized for their service. Let us work towards a common goal: fairness, justice, and dignity for our nation's public servants. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and voting yes on cloture.
