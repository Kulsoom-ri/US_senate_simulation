Tammy Baldwin: The bill before us today, introduced by Senator Crapo, seeks to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing the rule titled Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles. As a senator from Wisconsin, I have always been committed to protecting our environment and promoting public health.

After careful consideration, I must express my strong opposition to this bill. The rule in question aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants from light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, which is a crucial step in addressing the climate crisis and improving air quality. By phasing in more stringent standards over model years 2027 through 2032, we can significantly reduce the negative impacts of vehicle emissions on our environment and public health.

I am concerned that this bill would undermine the EPA's authority to regulate emissions and hinder our progress in reducing pollution. It is our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that we are taking proactive steps to protect the health and well-being of our citizens, particularly our children and vulnerable populations who are disproportionately affected by air pollution.

Furthermore, I believe that investing in clean energy and reducing emissions is not only a moral imperative, but also an economic opportunity. By promoting the development and deployment of clean technologies, we can create jobs, stimulate innovation, and drive economic growth.

In light of these considerations, I will be voting against this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this measure and instead work towards finding bipartisan solutions that prioritize the health of our planet and the well-being of our citizens.

As for the comments from my colleagues, I would like to respond to the argument that this bill is necessary to protect the automotive industry. While I understand the importance of supporting our domestic industries, I firmly believe that we can achieve a balance between economic growth and environmental protection. In fact, many automakers have already begun to invest in clean technologies and are poised to lead the transition to a low-carbon economy.

I would like to ask my colleagues to consider the long-term benefits of reducing emissions and promoting clean energy. Not only will this help to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, but it will also create new opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the clean energy sector.

Let us work together to find solutions that prioritize the health of our planet and the well-being of our citizens, rather than undermining the progress we have made so far. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this bill and instead support efforts to reduce emissions and promote clean energy.

John Barrasso: As I stand here today, I strongly support the bill introduced by Senator Crapo to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing the rule titled Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles. 

As a senator from Wyoming, I have seen firsthand the impact of overly burdensome regulations on our economy and our energy industry. This rule, if implemented, would have devastating effects on the automotive industry, leading to increased costs for consumers and potentially even job losses. 

I understand that my colleague, Senator Baldwin, has expressed concerns about the environmental impact of this bill. However, I believe that we can achieve a balance between environmental protection and economic growth. The rule in question is an overreach of the EPA's authority, and it's our responsibility as lawmakers to ensure that we're not stifling innovation and economic growth with overly restrictive regulations.

I'd like to address Senator Baldwin's point about the automotive industry's ability to invest in clean technologies. While it's true that some automakers have begun to invest in clean technologies, we must also consider the potential consequences of forcing an unrealistic timeline for implementation. This rule would phase in more stringent standards over model years 2027 through 2032, which could lead to significant increases in vehicle costs, making them less affordable for many Americans.

As someone who has worked on energy policy for many years, I believe that we should be promoting American energy production, including fossil fuels, rather than trying to stifle it with overly restrictive regulations.

Thomas R. Carper: The bill before us today, introduced by Senator Crapo, would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing the rule titled Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles. As the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I have given this issue careful consideration, and I must say that I strongly oppose this bill.

As a senator from Delaware, I have seen firsthand the devastating impacts of climate change on our communities, from rising sea levels to more frequent natural disasters. The rule in question is a crucial step in addressing the climate crisis and improving air quality.

I understand that some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule. However, I believe that investing in clean energy and reducing emissions is not only a moral imperative, but also an economic opportunity. By promoting the development and deployment of clean technologies, we can create jobs, stimulate innovation, and drive economic growth.

I agree with Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Butler, and Cantwell, who have highlighted the importance of addressing the disproportionate impact of air pollution on communities of color and low-income communities.

As someone who has worked tirelessly to promote the development of clean energy technologies and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, I believe that investing in clean energy and reducing emissions is not only a moral imperative, but also an economic opportunity. It can create jobs, stimulate innovation, and drive economic growth.

I also want to address the concerns raised by some of my colleagues about the potential impact of this rule on the automotive industry. I believe that the industry is already transitioning towards cleaner and more efficient vehicles, and this rule will simply provide a necessary framework for that transition. In fact, many of the major automakers have already expressed support for this rule, recognizing that it is a necessary step towards reducing emissions and improving public health.

I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term consequences of their actions and to think about the kind of world we want to leave for our children and grandchildren.

Sherrod Brown: I strongly disagree with the approach taken by Senator Crapo and the other Republican senators who have spoken in favor of this bill. The rule in question, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants from light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, is a necessary step towards addressing the climate crisis and protecting the health and well-being of the American people.

As a senator from Ohio, I have seen the devastating impact of pollution on our communities and our environment. The city of Cleveland, in my state, has some of the worst air quality in the country, and it's not just a matter of aesthetics - it's a matter of life and death. The American Lung Association has estimated that nearly 4 in 10 Americans live in areas with unhealthy air, and that air pollution is responsible for tens of thousands of premature deaths each year.

The rule that this bill seeks to block is a critical step towards reducing those emissions and protecting public health. It's a common-sense measure that will help to reduce the burden of air pollution on our communities, and it's a necessary step towards meeting our international obligations to address the climate crisis.

I also want to address the concerns that have been raised about the potential economic impacts of this rule. While I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential costs of implementing this rule, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the costs. In fact, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that the clean car standards implemented by the Obama administration would save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons.

Furthermore, I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards creating a level playing field for American businesses. By setting strong standards for emissions, we can ensure that all companies are playing by the same rules, and that no one is able to gain a competitive advantage by polluting more. This will help to create jobs, stimulate innovation, and drive economic growth, while also protecting the health and well-being of the American people.

In conclusion, I will be voting "No" on this bill. I believe that the rule in question is a necessary step towards addressing the climate crisis, protecting public health, and creating a level playing field for American businesses. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and to work with me to find solutions that will help to address the climate crisis, while also supporting our domestic industries and economy.

We must think about the kind of world we want to leave for our children and grandchildren, but we must also think about the kind of economy we want to leave for them.

In North Carolina, we have a significant automotive industry, and I am concerned about the potential impact of this rule on our state's economy. I believe that we must prioritize American energy independence and support our domestic industries, rather than relying on foreign sources of energy.

I urge my colleagues to consider the potential impacts of this rule on their states and industries, and to think about the kind of world we want to leave for future generations.

As a senator from California, I have seen the devastating impact of climate change on our communities and our environment. The rule in question, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants from light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, is a necessary step towards addressing the climate crisis and protecting the health and well-being of the American people.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential economic impacts of this rule, but I believe that the benefits far outweigh the costs. In fact, California has already implemented similar standards, and we have seen significant economic benefits as a result. Our clean car standards have created jobs, stimulated innovation, and driven economic growth, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving public health.

I also want to address the concerns that have been raised about the potential impact of this rule on the automotive industry. While I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential costs of implementing this rule, I believe that the industry is already moving in this direction. Many automakers have already committed to producing more electric and hybrid vehicles, and this rule will help to create a level playing field for all companies.

In conclusion, I will be voting "No" on this bill. I believe that the rule in question is a necessary step towards addressing the climate crisis, protecting public health, and creating a level playing field for American businesses. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and to work with me to find solutions that will help to address the climate crisis, while also supporting our domestic industries and economy.

As a senator from Washington, I have seen the devastating impact of climate change on our communities and our environment. The rule that this bill seeks to block is a critical step towards reducing those emissions and protecting public health. It's a common-sense measure that will help to reduce the burden of air pollution on our communities, and it's a necessary step towards meeting our international obligations to address the climate crisis.

In fact, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found that the clean car standards implemented by the Obama administration would save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons.

Furthermore, I believe that this rule is a necessary step towards creating a level playing field for American businesses. By setting strong standards for emissions, we can ensure that all companies are playing by the same rules, and that no one is able to gain a competitive advantage by polluting more. This will help to create jobs, stimulate innovation, and drive economic growth, while also protecting the health and well-being of the American people.

The rule in question, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants from light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, is a complex issue that requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach.

I have listened to the arguments presented by my colleagues, including Senators Brown, Budd, Butler, and Cantwell, and I appreciate their perspectives on this issue.

It's a common-sense measure that will help to reduce the burden of air pollution on our communities, and it's a necessary step towards meeting our international obligations to address the climate crisis.

The rule in question, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants from light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, is a complex issue that requires a balanced approach.

As a senator from North Dakota, I have seen the devastating impact of overregulation on our industries and economy. I am concerned that this rule could have similar negative impacts on our automotive industry and other industries that are critical to our state's economy. I believe that we must take a more balanced approach that considers the economic impacts of this rule and works to find solutions that address the climate crisis while also supporting our domestic industries and economy.

I understand that some of my colleagues may believe that this rule is a necessary step towards addressing the climate crisis, but I believe that we must also consider the potential economic impacts of this rule on our industries and communities. I am willing to work with my colleagues to find a solution that addresses the climate crisis while also supporting our domestic industries and economy.

In response to Senators Coons, Cortez Masto, and others who have expressed opposition to this bill, I must respectfully disagree with their assessments of the rule.

I will be voting "Yes" on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and working with me to find solutions that will help to address the climate crisis, while also supporting our domestic industries and economy.

In particular, I would like to address the comments made by Senator Coons, who mentioned that the clean car standards implemented by the Obama administration would save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons. While I appreciate the senator's concern for the environment, I believe that we must also consider the potential costs of implementing such standards, including the impact on American jobs and industries.

As a senator who has worked on energy issues for many years, I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing the climate crisis, one that considers the needs of our economy, our industries, and our communities. This bill is a necessary step towards achieving that goal, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Mike Crapo: As the sponsor of this bill, I'm pleased to see the debate unfolding on the Senate floor. I strongly believe that the Environmental Protection Agency's rule on multi-pollutant emissions standards for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles is an overreach of their authority. The rule's stringent standards would have devastating effects on our automotive industry, leading to increased costs for consumers and potential job losses.

I understand that some of my colleagues, like Senators Cortez Masto and Coons, have expressed concerns about the climate crisis and the need for action. I share their concern, but I believe we must take a balanced approach that considers the economic impacts of such regulations. We cannot simply impose costly standards on our industries without considering the consequences for American workers and families.

I appreciate the comments from my colleagues, Senators Cornyn, Cotton, and Cramer, who have expressed support for this bill. I agree with them that we must take a nuanced and targeted approach to addressing the climate crisis, one that supports our domestic industries and economy.

To those who argue that the clean car standards would save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs, I say that's a misleading figure. The costs of implementing such standards would far outweigh any potential savings, and we must consider the impact on American jobs and industries.

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, which would prohibit the EPA from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing this rule. We must take a thoughtful and balanced approach to addressing the climate crisis, and this bill is a necessary step towards achieving that goal.

As a senator from Texas, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of overregulation on our industries and economy.

I would like to address the comments made by Senator Durbin, who mentioned that the clean car standards would save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles. While I understand the potential benefits of these standards, I believe that we must also consider the costs of implementing such standards and the impact on American jobs and industries.

In conclusion, I will be voting "Yes" on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. We must take a thoughtful and balanced approach to addressing the climate crisis, and this bill is a necessary step towards achieving that goal. As a senator who has always put the interests of my constituents first, I believe that this bill is a crucial step towards promoting a strong and prosperous economy, and I will continue to work tirelessly to protect the interests of the people of Missouri.

Martin Heinrich: I strongly disagree with the approach taken by Senator Crapo and the other Republican senators who have spoken in favor of this bill. As a senator from New Mexico, I have seen the devastating impact of climate change on our communities, from more frequent and severe droughts to increased air pollution. The clean car standards implemented by the Obama administration have already shown significant benefits, including saving consumers money in fuel costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential economic impacts of this rule on our industries and communities. However, I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing the climate crisis, one that considers the long-term benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting clean energy.

The bill before us today would prohibit the EPA from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing this rule, which would be a significant step backward in our efforts to address the climate crisis. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and instead work towards finding solutions that support our domestic industries and economy while also protecting the health and well-being of the American people.

I'd like to address the comments made by Senators Ernst, Fischer, and others who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule.

As a former geologist and governor of Colorado, I have seen firsthand the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection. I believe that we can create jobs and stimulate economic growth while also reducing our carbon footprint and promoting clean energy. In fact, the clean energy industry is already creating thousands of jobs in Colorado and driving economic growth in our state.

I'd like to address the comments made by Senators Ernst, Fischer, and others who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impacts of this rule. While I understand their concerns, I believe that we must also consider the long-term benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting clean energy.

Mazie K. Hirono: The bill before us today is a clear example of the Republican party's continued efforts to undermine our nation's progress in addressing the climate crisis. As a senator from Hawaii, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of climate change on our communities, from rising sea levels to increased air pollution. The clean car standards implemented by the Obama administration have already shown significant benefits, including saving consumers money in fuel costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

I strongly disagree with the approach taken by Senator Crapo and the other Republican senators who have spoken in favor of this bill. This bill would prohibit the EPA from finalizing, implementing, or enforcing the rule on multi-pollutant emissions standards for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, which would be a significant step backward in our efforts to address the climate crisis.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential economic impacts of this rule on our industries and communities. However, I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing the climate crisis, one that considers the long-term benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting clean energy.

John Hoeven: As I consider the bill before us today, I must say that I strongly support the approach taken by Senator Crapo and the other Republican senators who have spoken in favor of this bill.

The automotive industry is a vital part of our state's economy, and this rule would only add to the challenges they already face.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Hawley, Ernst, and Fischer, that this rule is a classic example of government overreach and regulatory excess. The costs of implementing such standards would far outweigh any potential savings, and we must consider the impact on American jobs and industries. I understand that some of my colleagues, such as Senators Durbin, Fetterman, and Gillibrand, may believe that this rule is a necessary step towards addressing the climate crisis. However, I believe that we must take a balanced approach that considers the economic impacts of such regulations.

John Kennedy: The bill before us today, introduced by Senator Crapo, is a necessary step towards reining in the out-of-control Environmental Protection Agency. As a senator from Louisiana, I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of overregulation on our industries and economy. The automotive industry is a vital part of our state's economy, and this rule would only add to the challenges they already face.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, that this rule is a classic example of government overreach and regulatory excess. The costs of implementing such standards would far outweigh any potential savings, and we must consider the impact on American jobs and industries. I understand that some of my colleagues may believe that this rule is a necessary step towards addressing the climate crisis, but I believe that we must take a balanced approach that considers the economic impacts of such regulations.

As a senator who has worked tirelessly to promote the interests of my constituents and promote a strong and prosperous economy, I am committed to protecting the interests of my constituents and promoting a strong and prosperous economy.

I'd like to respond to my colleagues, Senators Kaine and Kelly, who have expressed concerns about the potential health and environmental benefits of this rule. While I understand their concerns, I believe that we must also consider the potential economic impacts of this rule on our industries and communities. We cannot simply impose costly standards on our industries without considering the consequences for American workers and families.

I will be voting "Yes" on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

As a senator who has always put the interests of my constituents first, I believe that this bill is a crucial step towards promoting a strong and prosperous economy, and I will continue to work tirelessly to protect the interests of the people of Louisiana.

And let me tell you, I'm not buying the argument that these clean car standards will save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles. That's just a bunch of fancy math, and I'm not convinced that it's going to benefit the average American family. What I am convinced of is that this rule will lead to higher costs for American workers and families, and that's something that I just can't support.

So, I'll be voting "Yes" on this bill, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in taking a stand against government overreach and regulatory excess. Let's work together to find a better way forward, one that supports our economy, our environment, and the health and well-being of the American people.

Angus S. King Jr.: The debate on this bill has been quite lively, and I appreciate the passion and conviction of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As an independent senator from Maine, I've always tried to approach these issues with a balanced and nuanced perspective.

While I understand the concerns about government overreach and regulatory excess, I also believe that we have a responsibility to protect the environment and public health. The clean car standards in question have been shown to have numerous benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving consumers money on fuel costs.

As someone who's worked on energy and environmental issues for many years, I'm convinced that we can find a way to balance our economic and environmental interests. However, I'm not convinced that this bill is the right approach. By prohibiting the EPA from finalizing and implementing these standards, we're essentially taking a step backward on our efforts to address climate change.

I'd like to respond to some of my colleagues who've expressed concerns about the economic impacts of these standards. While it's true that implementing these standards may require some upfront investments, I believe that the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs. In fact, many of the major automakers have already begun to invest in electric and hybrid vehicles, and they're seeing significant returns on those investments.

Furthermore, I think it's shortsighted to focus solely on the costs of implementing these standards without considering the costs of inaction. Climate change is already having a devastating impact on our economy, from more frequent natural disasters to disrupted supply chains. By taking proactive steps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we can help mitigate those costs and create a more sustainable future for our economy and our environment.

So, after careful consideration, I've decided to vote "No" on this bill. I believe that we should be working together to find solutions that support our domestic industries and economy while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting clean energy. Let's work together to find a better way forward, one that supports our economy, our environment, and the health and well-being of the American people.

I would like to address the comments made by Senator Kennedy, who mentioned that the argument that these clean car standards will save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles is just a bunch of fancy math. I disagree with that assessment, and I believe that the data and the science are clear: these standards will have significant benefits for American consumers and for our environment.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and to work together to find a better way forward, one that supports our economy, our environment, and the health and well-being of the American people.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who support the clean car standards, I believe that this rule would impose significant costs on the automotive industry, which is a vital part of our nation's economy.

However, I also understand the concerns of my colleagues who believe that this rule would impose significant costs on the automotive industry. As a fiscal conservative, I believe that we must be mindful of the economic impacts of our actions. But I also believe that we cannot simply ignore the devastating impact of climate change on our economy and our environment. The cost of inaction far outweighs the costs of implementing these standards.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote "No" on this bill. I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to energy policy, one that considers the needs of our economy, our environment, and our communities. While I appreciate the efforts of Senator Crapo to promote a balanced approach to energy policy, I believe that this bill does not strike the right balance.

Bernard Sanders: The bill before us today, introduced by Senator Crapo, is a perfect example of the Republican Party's ongoing war against the environment and the health of the American people. This bill would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from implementing new standards for greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles. It's a shameful attempt to undermine the progress we've made in reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to clean energy.

As a democratic socialist, I believe that it's our moral obligation to protect the planet and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. The science is clear: climate change is real, it's caused by human activity, and it's having devastating impacts on our environment, our economy, and our communities.

The clean car standards in question would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also save consumers money on fuel costs, improve air quality, and create jobs in the clean energy sector. But instead of supporting these common-sense standards, my Republican colleagues are putting the interests of the fossil fuel industry and big corporations ahead of the well-being of the American people.

I strongly disagree with the arguments made by Senators Risch, Rounds, and Rubio, who claim that these standards would impose significant costs on the automotive industry. The truth is that the cost of inaction far outweighs the costs of implementing these standards. Climate change is already costing our economy billions of dollars each year, and if we don't take bold action to reduce our emissions, the consequences will be catastrophic.

I commend my colleagues, Senators Romney, Rosen, and others, who have spoken out against this bill and in favor of taking action to address the climate crisis. We must work together to find a comprehensive approach to energy policy that prioritizes the health and well-being of the American people, supports our domestic industries, and protects the environment.

I will be voting "No" on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this misguided attempt to undermine our environmental protections. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren to take bold action to address the climate crisis, and I will continue to fight tirelessly for a sustainable future for all.

I would like to respond to Senator Schumer's comments, and I agree with him that this bill is a misguided attempt to undermine the progress we've made in reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to clean energy.

I will be voting "No" on this bill, as I believe that it would undermine the progress we've made in reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to clean energy. I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting clean energy, and to join me in opposing this bill. Let's work together to find a better way forward, one that supports our economy, our environment, and the health and well-being of the American people.

And I must say, I was particularly disappointed by Senator Tuberville's comment that there's one person who changes the climate in this country, and that's God. While I believe that faith can play an important role in guiding our actions, I also believe that we have a responsibility to take action to address the climate crisis. We cannot simply rely on divine intervention to solve this problem. We must take concrete steps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean energy.

In conclusion, I believe that this bill is a misguided attempt to undermine the progress we've made in reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to clean energy. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and to instead support a comprehensive approach to energy policy that considers the needs of our economy, our environment, and our communities. I will be voting "No" on this bill.

Todd Young: The debate on this bill has been quite lively, and I appreciate the passion and conviction of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As a senator from Indiana, I have to say that I strongly support the approach taken by Senator Crapo and the cosponsors of this bill. The clean car standards in question are a costly burden on the automotive industry, and I believe that we must consider the potential economic impacts of this rule.

While I understand that some of my colleagues may believe that this rule is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean energy, I believe that we must also consider the potential job losses and economic harm that this rule could cause. The automotive industry is a vital part of our economy, and we cannot simply ignore the potential consequences of this rule on American workers and businesses.

I'd like to commend my colleagues, Senators Thune, Tillis, Tuberville, and Vance, for their thoughtful arguments in favor of this bill. Their commitment to protecting American jobs and promoting economic growth is inspiring, and I am proud to stand with them in support of this bill.

As a member of the Senate, I believe that we must take a balanced approach to energy policy, one that considers the needs of our economy, our environment, and our communities. We cannot simply impose our own environmental interests over the economic well-being of the American people.

In response to my colleagues, Senators Warner, Warren, Welch, and Whitehouse, who have expressed concerns about the potential environmental impacts of this bill, I believe that we must also consider the potential economic benefits of this bill. We cannot simply ignore the potential job losses and economic harm that this rule could cause.

I will be voting "Yes" on this bill, as I believe that it would help to protect American jobs and promote economic growth. I urge my colleagues to consider the potential economic benefits of this bill and to join me in supporting it. Let's work together to find a better way forward, one that supports our economy, our environment, and the health and well-being of the American people.

I must say, I was particularly disappointed by the comments made by some of my colleagues, who seem to believe that we can simply rely on government regulations to solve the climate crisis. While I believe that government can play a role in addressing this issue, I also believe that we must take a more balanced approach that considers the potential economic impacts of our actions. We cannot simply impose our own environmental interests over the economic well-being of the American people.

In conclusion, I believe that this bill is a necessary step towards protecting American jobs and promoting economic growth. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and to instead oppose the costly and burdensome clean car standards that are currently in place. I will be voting "Yes" on this bill.
