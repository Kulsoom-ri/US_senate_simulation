John Kennedy: I'm a fiscal conservative, and I've got to say, I'm a bit skeptical about this bill. Now, I know some of my colleagues think it's a great idea to study the effects of cannabis on our veterans, but I'm not so sure. I mean, we're talking about a substance that's still illegal under federal law, and we're gonna start giving it to our veterans? I don't know if that's such a good idea.

Now, I'm not opposed to exploring alternative options for our veterans who are suffering from PTSD and chronic pain. But I think we need to be careful, and we need to make sure that we're not putting our veterans in harm's way. I've heard some of my colleagues say that this bill has been carefully crafted to address the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the use of cannabis, but I'm not convinced.

So, I'm gonna have to vote no on cloture.

I'm not opposed to exploring alternative options, but I think we need to do it in a responsible and safe manner.

And let me tell you, I'm not impressed by the fact that this bill has 9 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. Just because it's bipartisan doesn't mean it's a good idea. I'm gonna have to look at the merits of the bill, and make my own decision. And right now, I'm just not convinced that this is the right thing to do.

So, I'll be voting no on cloture, and I hope that my colleagues will consider my concerns. We need to be careful, and we need to make sure that we're doing what's best for our veterans.

As a senator from Missouri, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of drug abuse and addiction in my state.
