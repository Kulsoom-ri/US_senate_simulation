Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today, introduced by Senator Rand Paul, seeks to direct the President to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in, or affecting, Niger within 30 days of this resolution's adoption, unless a declaration of war or specific authorization for such use of the Armed Forces has been enacted.

As a senator, I have always believed in the importance of congressional oversight and accountability when it comes to our nation's military engagements. The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, and it is our responsibility to ensure that our military actions are authorized and aligned with our national interests.

While I understand the concerns about the ongoing military presence in Niger, I also recognize the complexities of the situation and the need for a thoughtful and informed approach. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has been referred this bill, and I believe it is essential that we allow the committee to thoroughly review and consider the implications of this resolution.

Therefore, I will be voting against the motion to discharge. I believe that the committee should be given the opportunity to hold hearings, gather information, and engage in a thorough discussion about the merits of this resolution. By doing so, we can ensure that any decision we make is informed, deliberate, and in the best interests of our nation and our military personnel.

I would like to hear more from Senator Paul and other supporters of this resolution about their concerns and the rationale behind this proposal. I am open to considering the merits of this resolution, but I believe that we must follow the proper procedures and allow for a thorough examination of the issues at hand.

Let us proceed with caution and diligence, and let us work together to ensure that our military actions are aligned with our values, our interests, and our constitutional responsibilities.

However, I must respectfully disagree with Senator Baldwin's decision to vote against the motion to discharge. While I acknowledge the need for a thorough review of this resolution, I believe that the situation in Niger warrants immediate attention and action.

As a nation, we have been involved in military hostilities in Niger for far too long without a clear authorization from Congress. This is not only a constitutional issue, but it also raises concerns about the safety and well-being of our military personnel who are serving in the region.

I commend Senator Paul for introducing this joint resolution, which seeks to bring much-needed transparency and accountability to our military actions in Niger. By supporting this motion to discharge, we can ensure that the President is held accountable for our nation's military engagements and that Congress is able to fulfill its constitutional duty to declare war.

I would like to ask Senator Paul to elaborate on the rationale behind this proposal and to provide more information about the current situation in Niger. I believe that it is essential for us to have a thorough understanding of the issues at hand before making a decision, and I look forward to hearing more from Senator Paul and other supporters of this resolution.

Rand Paul: As the senator who introduced this joint resolution, I'd like to start by saying that I'm pleased to see my colleagues engaging in a thoughtful and nuanced discussion about this issue. The question before us today is not about whether we support our military personnel, but about whether we will uphold our constitutional responsibility to authorize military action.

I've heard some of my colleagues express concerns about the potential consequences of withdrawing our military presence in Niger. I understand those concerns, but I must respectfully disagree. The fact is, we have been involved in military hostilities in Niger for years without a declaration of war or specific authorization from Congress. This is a clear violation of our constitutional authority, and it's our duty to address it.

I'd like to respond to Senator Murphy, who said that we need to take a more cautious and careful approach to this issue. I agree that caution is necessary, but I believe that we've had plenty of time to consider this issue. We've been involved in Niger for years, and it's time for us to take a stand and assert our constitutional authority.

I'd also like to address Senator Murray, who said that we need to prioritize the safety and well-being of our military personnel. I couldn't agree more. But I believe that the best way to do that is to ensure that our military actions are authorized, necessary, and aligned with our national interests. That's exactly what this joint resolution aims to do.

To Senator Ossoff, I'd like to say that I appreciate his thoughtful comments on this issue. I agree that we need to take a nuanced and thoughtful approach to this issue, and I believe that this joint resolution does just that.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to discharge. It's time for us to take a stand and assert our constitutional authority. We owe it to our military personnel, our constituents, and our nation to ensure that our military actions are authorized, necessary, and aligned with our values and our interests. I will be voting yes on this motion, and I hope that my colleagues will join me.

Bernard Sanders: My fellow senators, I rise today to express my strong support for the motion to discharge the joint resolution introduced by Senator Rand Paul. This resolution is a crucial step towards reasserting Congress's constitutional authority over matters of war and peace.

As a nation, we have been engaged in countless military interventions and wars without proper authorization from Congress. This has led to a situation where the executive branch has virtually unchecked power to wage war, undermining the very foundations of our democracy.

The situation in Niger is a prime example of this. We have been involved in military operations in that country for years, with little to no oversight or authorization from Congress. This is unacceptable and a clear violation of the Constitution.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the potential consequences of withdrawing our military presence in Niger. But I say to them, what is the alternative? Are we to continue down a path of endless war and intervention, without any regard for the Constitution or the will of the American people?

We must take a stand for our Constitution and our national interests. We must ensure that our military actions are authorized, necessary, and aligned with our values and interests. This is not a partisan issue, but a matter of fundamental principle.

I commend Senator Paul for his efforts to reassert Congress's constitutional authority, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion to discharge. Let us work together to find a solution that meets our constitutional responsibilities and ensures that our military actions are aligned with our national interests.

To my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of this resolution, I say that I understand and respect their perspectives. However, I must respectfully disagree with their decision to vote against the motion to discharge. We must prioritize a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to this issue, one that takes into account the complexities of the situation on the ground and the potential impact on our national security.

But we must also recognize that the status quo is unacceptable. We cannot continue to allow the executive branch to wage war without proper authorization from Congress. We must take a stand for our Constitution and our democracy.

I will be voting in favor of the motion to discharge, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to reassert Congress's constitutional authority and ensure that our military actions are aligned with our national interests.
