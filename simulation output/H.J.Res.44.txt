Tammy Baldwin: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must express my strong opposition to nullifying the rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. This rule is a crucial step in ensuring that firearms with attached stabilizing braces are subject to the same regulations as rifles under the National Firearms Act.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of gun violence on our communities. The rule in question is a common-sense measure that helps to prevent the misuse of these firearms, which can be easily converted into rifles that are capable of firing multiple rounds.

I understand that some of my colleagues may argue that this rule is an overreach of federal authority or an infringement on Second Amendment rights. However, I firmly believe that the safety of our communities must take precedence over any perceived inconvenience to gun owners.

Furthermore, I am concerned that nullifying this rule would send a dangerous signal that we are not committed to taking meaningful action to address the scourge of gun violence in our country. At a time when mass shootings and gun-related deaths are on the rise, we should be working to strengthen our gun laws, not weaken them.

For these reasons, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work towards finding common-sense solutions to the problem of gun violence that plague our nation.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what is the real motivation behind this effort? Is it truly about protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners, or is it about catering to the interests of the gun lobby? I hope that we can have a honest and nuanced discussion about the implications of this resolution, rather than simply relying on partisan rhetoric.

In any case, I will continue to fight for the safety and well-being of my constituents and the American people, even if it means standing up to powerful special interests. I will vote against this resolution and work towards a future where our communities are free from the fear of gun violence.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure. We must ensure that our laws and regulations are fair, reasonable, and effective in addressing the real problems facing our nation, rather than simply imposing unnecessary burdens on law-abiding citizens.

Joni Ernst: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must express my strong support for nullifying the rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding firearms with attached stabilizing braces. This rule is a clear overreach of federal authority and an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.

As a senator from Iowa and a veteran, I've seen the importance of protecting our constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms.

Dianne Feinstein: The debate on this joint resolution has been quite intense, with strong arguments on both sides. As a senator who has long been a champion of gun control and public safety, I must express my strong opposition to this joint resolution.

The rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding firearms with attached stabilizing braces is a necessary step to prevent gun violence and protect our communities.

By clarifying the criteria for determining whether a firearm with a stabilizing brace is a rifle, we can prevent these devices from being used to evade the law and increase the risk of gun violence.

Elizabeth Warren: I strongly oppose this joint resolution that seeks to nullify the rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding firearms with attached stabilizing braces. As a senator from Massachusetts and a strong advocate for common-sense gun safety laws, I firmly believe that this rule is a necessary step to prevent gun violence and protect our communities.

The rule in question is a reasonable and necessary measure to ensure that firearms with attached stabilizing braces are subject to the same regulations as other rifles. This is not about restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners, but about ensuring that our communities are safe from gun violence. The fact that some of my colleagues are trying to undermine this rule is deeply troubling, and I will not stand idly by while they attempt to put the interests of the gun lobby above the safety and well-being of our citizens.

I believe that this rule is a reasonable and necessary measure to ensure public safety, and I will not be swayed by partisan rhetoric and misguided arguments.

As a senator, I have seen the devastating effects of gun violence firsthand, and I have worked tirelessly to pass common-sense gun safety laws that protect our citizens.

However, I believe that this rule is a reasonable and necessary measure to ensure that firearms with attached stabilizing braces are subject to the same regulations as other rifles. This is not about restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners, but about ensuring that our communities are safe from gun violence.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Brown, Cardin, Carper, Casey, and Collins, who have spoken out in opposition to this resolution. Their arguments are well-reasoned and based on a deep understanding of the need for common-sense gun safety laws.

In response to my colleagues who have spoken out in support of this resolution, I would like to say that I understand their concerns about the Second Amendment, but I believe that this rule is not an infringement on the rights of law-abiding citizens.

As a senator, I have seen the devastating effects of gun violence firsthand, and I have worked tirelessly to pass common-sense gun safety laws that protect our citizens. This rule is a crucial step in that effort, and I will not stand idly by while my colleagues attempt to undermine it.

I will be voting "Nay" on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for the safety and well-being of our communities. We owe it to our constituents and the American people to take meaningful action to address the complex issues surrounding gun violence, and I believe that this joint resolution is a step in the wrong direction. Let us prioritize the safety and well-being of our communities and take meaningful action to prevent gun violence, while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens.

I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term consequences of their actions and to join me in standing up for the safety and well-being of our communities.

We need to focus on common-sense solutions that address the root causes of gun violence, such as mental health and gang violence.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, who have spoken out in support of this resolution. Their arguments are well-reasoned and based on a deep understanding of the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding citizens.

To those who oppose this resolution, I say: how can you justify allowing the federal government to overstep its authority and infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens? Don't we have a responsibility to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens and to ensure that our communities are safe?

I'll be voting "Yea" on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We need to stand up for the rights of law-abiding citizens and reject this misguided rule. As a senator who has always been committed to upholding the Constitution and protecting the rights of Louisianans, I believe that this vote is a critical step in defending our Second Amendment rights and ensuring that our citizens can continue to exercise their right to bear arms.

Angus S. King Jr.: The debate on this joint resolution has been quite lively, with strong opinions on both sides. As an independent senator from Maine, I've always tried to approach these issues with a balanced perspective, considering the concerns of all parties involved.

While I understand the concerns about gun violence and the need to take action to prevent it, I also believe that we must be careful not to infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens. The Second Amendment is a fundamental right that must be protected, and we must ensure that any regulations or rules we put in place do not unfairly restrict the ability of citizens to exercise that right.

In this case, I have concerns about the rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding firearms with attached stabilizing braces. While I understand the intent behind the rule, I believe that it may be overly broad and could potentially infringe on the rights of law-abiding gun owners.

As I weigh the arguments on both sides, I am reminded of my own experiences as a governor and a senator. I've always tried to find common-sense solutions that balance competing interests and priorities. In this case, I believe that we need to take a closer look at the rule and consider whether it is truly necessary to achieve our goals of preventing gun violence.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote "Nay" on this joint resolution. While I understand the concerns about the rule, I believe that it is a necessary step to prevent gun violence and protect our communities. I urge my colleagues to work with me to find common-sense solutions that prioritize public safety while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens.

To my colleagues who have spoken out in support of this resolution, I respect your passion and commitment to the Second Amendment. However, I would like to ask: how can we justify allowing the proliferation of dangerous weapons that can be used to harm innocent people? Don't we have a responsibility to take action to prevent gun violence and protect our communities?

To those who oppose this resolution, I say: let us work together to find solutions that balance our competing interests and priorities. Let us prioritize public safety while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. I believe that we can find common ground and work towards a solution that benefits everyone.

In conclusion, I will be voting "Nay" on this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and in supporting common-sense gun safety laws that will help to prevent gun violence and keep our communities safe. We have a responsibility to protect the public and to ensure that our communities are safe. Let us work together to find solutions that prioritize public safety and protect the rights of law-abiding citizens.

Amy Klobuchar: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I must express my strong opposition to nullifying the rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding firearms with attached stabilizing braces.

The fact that the ATF has chosen to target firearms with attached stabilizing braces, which can be used to convert a pistol into a short-barreled rifle, is a necessary step to prevent the proliferation of these dangerous weapons.

I'll be voting "Yea" on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We need to stand up for the rights of law-abiding citizens and reject this misguided rule.

In response to Senator Menendez, I would like to say that I understand your concerns about gun violence, but I believe that this rule is not a common-sense solution.

Lisa Murkowski: As I consider this joint resolution, I must say that I have some reservations about the rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding firearms with attached stabilizing braces. While I understand the concerns about gun violence and the need to regulate certain types of firearms, I also believe that we must be careful not to infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens.

As a senator from Alaska, I have a strong tradition of supporting the Second Amendment and the rights of gun owners in my state. However, I also believe that we must take a nuanced approach to this issue and consider the potential consequences of nullifying this rule.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote "Yea" on this joint resolution. I believe that the rule issued by the ATF is an overreach of federal authority and an infringement on the rights of law-abiding citizens.

Christopher Murphy: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding firearms with attached stabilizing braces. As a senator from Connecticut and a long-time advocate for common-sense gun safety laws, I firmly believe that this rule is a necessary step to prevent gun violence and protect our communities.

The ATF's rule is a common-sense solution that will help to prevent the proliferation of dangerous weapons that can be used to harm innocent people. Firearms with attached stabilizing braces can be used to convert a pistol into a short-barreled rifle, which is a highly dangerous and potentially lethal weapon. By regulating these firearms, we can help to prevent gun violence and keep our communities safe.

To my colleagues who are considering voting in favor of this resolution, I ask: what is the cost of inaction? How many more lives must be lost to gun violence before we take action to prevent it? We have a moral obligation to act, and I urge you to join me in opposing this joint resolution and supporting common-sense gun safety laws.

In conclusion, I will be voting "Nay" on this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to do the same and to stand up for the safety and well-being of our communities.

I believe that this rule is not an overreach of federal authority, but rather a necessary step to prevent gun violence. The federal government has a responsibility to regulate dangerous weapons and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.

I'd also like to respond to Senator Mullin's comment, "we need to focus on addressing the root causes of gun violence, such as mental health and gang violence, rather than restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens." I agree that addressing the root causes of gun violence is crucial, but I believe that regulating dangerous weapons is also an important step in preventing gun violence. We can't just focus on one aspect of the problem; we need to take a comprehensive approach that includes both addressing the root causes of gun violence and regulating dangerous weapons.

In short, I believe that this rule is a necessary step to prevent gun violence and protect our communities, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this joint resolution and supporting common-sense gun safety laws.

Rand Paul: I rise today to express my strong support for this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regarding firearms with attached stabilizing braces. As a senator from Kentucky and a long-time advocate for the Second Amendment, I firmly believe that this rule is an overreach of federal authority and an infringement on the rights of law-abiding citizens.

The ATF's rule is a clear example of bureaucratic overreach, and it's a perfect illustration of why we need to be vigilant in defending our constitutional rights. The rule would essentially allow the federal government to regulate certain types of firearms without any clear justification or evidence that they pose a significant threat to public safety.

I understand that some of my colleagues may argue that this rule is necessary to prevent gun violence, but I strongly disagree. We can't just restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens without any evidence that it will actually make a difference. We need to focus on addressing the root causes of gun violence, such as mental health and gang violence, rather than just restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens.

I'd like to respond to Senator Murphy's comment, "what is the cost of inaction?" I believe that the cost of inaction is not just about the number of lives lost to gun violence, but also about the erosion of our constitutional rights. If we allow the federal government to overstep its authority and restrict our rights without any clear justification, we will be setting a dangerous precedent that could have far-reaching consequences.

I'd also like to respond to Senator Murray's comment, "we have a moral obligation to act."

In conclusion, I will be voting "Yea" on this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to do the same and to stand up for the rights of law-abiding citizens.
