Tammy Baldwin: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I am compelled to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to the Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards. This rule is a crucial step forward in reducing air pollution, including ozone and particulate matter, from heavy-duty engines and vehicles.

The science is clear: air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. By setting stricter emission standards, we can reduce the burden of air pollution on our communities and promote cleaner, healthier air for all Americans.

I am disappointed, but not surprised, that this resolution has been introduced by Senator Fischer and has garnered support from 37 cosponsors. It is a clear attempt to undermine the progress we have made in addressing climate change and promoting environmental protection.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I am particularly concerned about the impact of air pollution on our state's rural communities, where heavy-duty vehicles often travel through and around. By supporting this resolution, my colleagues would be putting the interests of polluters and special interests above the health and well-being of our constituents.

I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term consequences of their vote. Do we want to prioritize the health and safety of our communities, or do we want to cater to the interests of polluters and special interests? The choice is clear.

I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We must stand strong in our commitment to protecting the environment and promoting public health. The American people deserve nothing less.

To my colleagues who support this resolution, I ask: what is the justification for undermining the EPA's authority to regulate air pollution? What evidence do you have that this rule is unnecessary or overly burdensome? I have not seen any credible arguments to support this resolution, and I fear that it is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to roll back environmental protections and prioritize special interests over the public good.

Let us stand together in opposition to this resolution and reaffirm our commitment to protecting the environment and promoting public health. The future of our planet and the health of our communities depend on it.

John Barrasso: As I stand on the Senate floor today, I am compelled to express my strong support for this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to the Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards. This rule, in my opinion, is an overreach of the EPA's authority and will have devastating consequences for our economy, particularly in states like Wyoming, where the energy industry is a vital part of our economy.

While I understand the importance of reducing air pollution, I believe that this rule goes too far and will lead to significant job losses and economic hardship for many Americans. The rule's stringent emission standards will make it difficult for manufacturers to comply, leading to increased costs and decreased competitiveness in the global market.

I also take issue with the notion that this rule is necessary to protect public health. While air pollution is certainly a concern, I believe that the EPA has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that this rule will have a significant impact on public health. In fact, many of the emissions reductions achieved by this rule could be accomplished through more targeted and cost-effective measures.

I would like to respond to my colleague, Senator Baldwin, who has expressed her opposition to this resolution. I understand her concerns about the impact of air pollution on public health, but I believe that she is misguided in her support for this rule. The fact is, this rule will have a disproportionate impact on rural communities, like those in Wyoming, where heavy-duty vehicles are often necessary for economic activity.

I would ask Senator Baldwin, what about the jobs that will be lost as a result of this rule? What about the economic hardship that will be inflicted on our communities? Is it really worth it to impose such stringent regulations on our economy, when the benefits to public health are uncertain at best?

I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. We must stand strong in our commitment to protecting American jobs and promoting economic growth, while also ensuring that our environmental regulations are reasonable and effective. The American people deserve nothing less.

To Senator Baldwin and other supporters of this rule, I say, let's work together to find a more balanced approach to reducing air pollution, one that takes into account the needs of our economy and our communities. We can do better than this overly broad and burdensome rule. Let's stand together in support of American jobs and economic growth, and against unnecessary and harmful regulations.

Michael F. Bennet: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of the delicate balance we must strike between protecting our environment and promoting economic growth. While I understand the concerns of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I must express my opposition to this resolution.

The Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to the Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards is a crucial step forward in reducing air pollution and promoting cleaner, healthier air for all Americans. The science is clear: air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, and those with pre-existing medical conditions.

As a senator from Colorado, I have seen firsthand the impact of air pollution on our communities. The Rocky Mountains, once a pristine and untouched wilderness, are now often shrouded in a haze of pollution. Our children deserve to grow up with clean air and water, and it is our responsibility to ensure that we are doing everything in our power to protect their health and well-being.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the economic impact of this rule, but I believe that we can find a way to balance our economic needs with our environmental responsibilities. In fact, many of the companies that will be affected by this rule are already working to develop cleaner, more efficient technologies. By supporting this rule, we can create jobs and stimulate innovation in the clean energy sector.

I would like to respond to my colleague, Senator Barrasso, who has expressed concerns about the impact of this rule on rural communities. I understand that the energy industry is a vital part of many rural economies, but I believe that we can find ways to support these communities while also protecting the environment. In fact, many rural communities are already leading the way in the development of clean energy technologies, such as wind and solar power.

To my colleagues who support overriding the veto, I ask: what is the justification for undermining the EPA's authority to regulate air pollution? What evidence do you have that this rule is unnecessary or overly burdensome? I have not seen any credible arguments to support this resolution, and I fear that it is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to roll back environmental protections and prioritize special interests over the public good.

Let us stand together in opposition to overriding the veto and reaffirm our commitment to protecting the environment and promoting public health. The future of our planet and the health of our communities depend on it. I will be voting "nay" on this joint resolution.

Robert P. Casey Jr.: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of my commitment to protecting the environment and promoting public health. The Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to the Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards is a crucial step forward in reducing air pollution and promoting cleaner, healthier air for all Americans.

I understand that some of my colleagues may be concerned about the economic impact of this rule, but I believe that we can find a way to balance our economic needs with our environmental responsibilities. In fact, many of the companies that will be affected by this rule are already working to develop cleaner, more efficient technologies. By supporting this rule, we can create jobs and stimulate innovation in the clean energy sector.

I would like to respond to my colleagues, such as Senator Ted Budd, who have expressed concerns about the impact of this rule on rural communities. I understand that the energy industry is a vital part of many rural economies, but I believe that we can find ways to support these communities while also protecting the environment. In fact, many rural communities are already leading the way in the development of clean energy technologies, such as wind and solar power.

The rule's emission standards are based on the best available science and are designed to reduce the harmful effects of air pollution on our communities.

I do not believe that we should delay or weaken these standards, particularly when the health and well-being of our citizens are at stake. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this joint resolution and working towards a solution that protects both our environment and our economy. I will be voting "nay" on this joint resolution.

In response to my colleagues who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impact of the rule, I would like to work with them to find a solution that balances our economic needs with our environmental responsibilities.

In conclusion, I believe that sustaining the President's veto and allowing the EPA's rule to take effect is the right course of action.

I will be voting "nay" on this joint resolution.

Joni Ernst: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of my commitment to finding a balance between our economic needs and our environmental responsibilities. The Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to the Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.

As a senator from Iowa, I understand the importance of protecting our environment, particularly in a state with a strong agricultural industry. However, I also recognize the need to support our economy and the industries that drive it. The rule's stringent emission standards may have a disproportionate impact on rural communities, where heavy-duty vehicles are often necessary for economic activity.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Braun, Britt, and Capito, that we can find more effective and efficient ways to reduce air pollution without imposing such burdensome regulations on our economy. I also appreciate the concerns expressed by Senators Brown, Cantwell, and others about the impact of air pollution on public health.

However, I believe that we can find ways to reduce air pollution without imposing overly burdensome regulations on our economy.

I would also like to address Senator Coons' comments about the need to prioritize the health and safety of our communities. I agree that this is a critical consideration, but I believe that we can find ways to balance our economic needs with our environmental responsibilities. We should be working towards solutions that promote both economic growth and environmental protection, rather than pitting one against the other.

In conclusion, I believe that overriding the President's veto and re-examining the EPA's rule is the right course of action. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution and working towards a more balanced solution that benefits everyone. I will be voting "yay" on this joint resolution.

As a senator from California, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of air pollution on our communities, particularly in the Central Valley and other areas with high levels of industrial activity. The rule's emission standards are designed to reduce air pollution, including ozone and particulate matter, from heavy-duty engines and vehicles. I believe that these standards are necessary to protect the health and well-being of our citizens, particularly vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, and those with pre-existing medical conditions.

I have reviewed the rule and consulted with various stakeholders, including environmental groups and industry leaders.

Deb Fischer: As the sponsor of this joint resolution, I rise today to urge my colleagues to override the President's veto and nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's rule relating to the Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards.

I understand that some of my colleagues, including Senators Durbin, Feinstein, and Fetterman, have expressed concerns about the impact of air pollution on public health. I share their concern for the health and well-being of our citizens, but I strongly believe that this rule is an overreach of the EPA's authority and will have a devastating impact on our economy, particularly in rural areas like Nebraska.

The rule's stringent emission standards will increase costs for farmers, truckers, and other small businesses that rely on heavy-duty vehicles, leading to higher prices for consumers and potentially even job losses. I've heard from numerous constituents in Nebraska who are concerned about the impact of this rule on their livelihoods, and I believe it's our duty to listen to their concerns and take action.

I urge my colleagues to join me in overriding the President's veto and sending a message that we will not stand idly by while the EPA imposes overly burdensome regulations on our economy.

We cannot simply impose stringent regulations without considering the potential consequences on our economy.

John Kennedy: I'm Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana, and I'm here to tell you that I'm voting "yay" on this joint resolution. Now, I know some of my colleagues are concerned about the potential impact on public health, and I get that. But let me tell you, I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen my fair share of regulations that sound good on paper but end up hurting the very people they're supposed to help.

This EPA rule is a perfect example of that. It's a classic case of overreach by the federal government, and it's going to hurt our economy, particularly in rural areas like those in my home state of Louisiana. I mean, think about it: this rule is going to increase costs for farmers, truckers, and other small businesses that rely on heavy-duty vehicles. That's going to lead to higher prices for consumers and potentially even job losses.

Now, I know some of my colleagues are saying, "But Senator Kennedy, we have to protect public health!" And I agree, we do. But we can't just impose regulations willy-nilly without considering the potential consequences. That's not how we do business in America. We need to find a balance between protecting our environment and promoting economic growth.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Schumer, Sanders, and Shaheen, who have highlighted the need to prioritize the health and well-being of our citizens. The science is clear: air pollution has devastating effects on our communities, particularly on vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. I believe that sustaining the President's veto and allowing the EPA's rule to take effect is the right course of action.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have carefully reviewed the EPA's rule and its potential impact on our economy. I believe that we can promote economic growth and job creation while also protecting our environment. In fact, investing in clean energy and reducing pollution can create new jobs and stimulate local economies.

I would like to respond to Senator Scott's comments, who argues that the costs of implementing this rule could lead to increased costs for farmers, manufacturers, and consumers. I believe that this is a false dichotomy, and that we can promote economic growth and job creation while also protecting our environment. We must consider the long-term benefits of reducing air pollution and promoting public health, rather than just focusing on short-term economic gains.

In conclusion, I believe that sustaining the President's veto and allowing the EPA's rule to take effect is the right course of action. I will be voting "nay" on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in taking a critical step in protecting our environment and promoting public health. The health and well-being of our citizens must come first, and I will fight to protect them.

As I prepare to cast my vote, I am mindful of the impact that this decision will have on the people of Michigan.

I urge my colleagues to join me in voting "nay" on this joint resolution and to prioritize the health and well-being of our citizens. Together, we can create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville, and I'm here to give my thoughts on this joint resolution. As a Christian conservative, I believe in being a good steward of the environment, but I also believe in being responsible with our economy. The EPA's rule on heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards is a classic example of overregulation, and I think it's a mistake.

I've listened to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I have to say, I agree with Senators Ricketts, Risch, and Rounds. This rule is going to lead to increased costs for farmers, manufacturers, and consumers, and that's not what we need right now. We need to be promoting economic growth and job creation, not imposing burdensome regulations that will harm our economy.

I understand that some of my colleagues, like Senator Stabenow, are concerned about the health and well-being of our citizens. And I agree, that's important. But we can't just focus on one aspect of this issue. We have to consider the economic impact, too. The increased costs of implementing this rule could lead to higher prices for consumers, and that's not going to help anyone.

I'm also concerned about the impact this rule could have on our energy industry. As someone who's from a state with a strong energy sector, I know how important it is to have a balanced approach to energy production. We can't just focus on one type of energy; we need to have a diverse range of options.

So, after careful consideration, I've decided to vote "yay" on this joint resolution. I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule is the right course of action. We need to find common-sense solutions that balance our economic needs with our environmental responsibilities. This joint resolution is a step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

And let me tell you, as someone who's not beholden to special interests or partisan politics, I'm not afraid to take a stand on this issue. I'm a politician's worst nightmare, because I don't need the money, I don't need the job, and I'm not going to be politically correct. I'm going to do what's right for the people of Alabama, and that's what I'm going to do here today.

Jacky Rosen: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of the critical importance of protecting our environment and public health.

As a senator from Nevada, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of air pollution on our communities, particularly on our children and vulnerable populations.

I understand that some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule, but I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals while also promoting economic growth and job creation.

While I understand the importance of protecting our environment and public health, I also believe that we must consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We cannot afford to prioritize the environment over the economy, or vice versa. We need to find a balance that works for everyone.

As a former governor of South Dakota, I have seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our state's economy. The EPA's rule would impose strict standards on heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which could lead to increased costs for our farmers and ranchers. This could have a devastating impact on our state's agricultural industry, which is a vital part of our economy.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Ricketts, Risch, and Romney, who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule.

Bernard Sanders: The joint resolution before us today is a clear example of the Republican Party's ongoing efforts to undermine the health and well-being of the American people.

As for the comments made by Senators Rosen, Sanders, and Schatz, I respectfully disagree. While I understand their concerns about the importance of protecting our environment and public health, I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals while also promoting economic growth and job creation.

In fact, I believe that the EPA's rule is a classic example of the kind of top-down, one-size-fits-all approach that has come to characterize the Biden administration's approach to regulation.

We can create jobs and stimulate economic growth while also protecting our environment and public health.

I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule is a necessary step in protecting the interests of our nation's industries and promoting economic growth. I urge my colleagues to join me in overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule. Let us work together to find a better approach that prioritizes the health and well-being of our citizens and promotes a sustainable future for our nation. But for now, I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule is the right decision.

John Thune: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of the importance of finding a balance between our economic and environmental interests. The EPA's rule on heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards is a well-intentioned effort to reduce air pollution, but I have concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule on our nation's industries, particularly in my home state of South Dakota.

As a senator who has consistently fought for pragmatic solutions, I believe that this joint resolution is an opportunity for us to re-examine the EPA's rule and consider alternative approaches that can achieve our environmental goals while also promoting economic growth. I agree with my colleagues, Senators Ricketts, Risch, Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule.

However, I also understand the importance of protecting our environment and public health, and I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing the environmental challenges we face. Investing in clean energy and reducing pollution can create new job opportunities and stimulate local economies. It's a win-win situation.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote "yay" on this joint resolution. I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule is a necessary step in protecting the interests of our nation's industries and promoting economic growth. I urge my colleagues to join me in overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule.

In South Dakota, we have a strong agricultural industry, and I believe that we can work with our farmers and ranchers to develop cleaner, more efficient vehicles that meet the needs of our economy and our environment. In fact, many of our farmers and ranchers are already investing in cleaner energy and more efficient vehicles, and I believe that this trend will continue as we move forward.

I would like to address the comments made by Senators Sanders, Schatz, and Schumer, who have expressed strong opposition to this joint resolution. While I understand their concerns about the importance of protecting our environment and public health, I believe that we can achieve our environmental goals while also promoting economic growth and job creation.

In fact, I believe that the EPA's rule is a classic example of the kind of top-down, one-size-fits-all approach that has come to characterize the Biden administration's approach to regulation. It's an approach that ignores the unique needs and challenges of different industries and regions, and instead imposes a rigid, inflexible set of standards that can only serve to stifle innovation and economic growth.

As a senator from South Dakota, I have seen firsthand the impact of overregulation on our state's economy. The EPA's rule would impose strict standards on heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which could lead to increased costs for our farmers, truckers, and small business owners. This could have a devastating impact on our state's economy, which is already struggling to recover from the pandemic.

Therefore, I will be voting "yay" on this joint resolution. I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule is a necessary step in protecting the interests of our nation's industries and promoting economic growth. I urge my colleagues to join me in overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule. Let us work together to find a better approach that prioritizes the health and well-being of our citizens and promotes a sustainable future for our nation. But for now, I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule is the right decision.

Thomas Tillis: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of the importance of balancing our economic and environmental interests. The EPA's rule on heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards is a well-intentioned effort to reduce air pollution, but I have concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule on our nation's industries, particularly in my home state of North Carolina.

As a senator who has consistently fought for pragmatic solutions, I believe that this joint resolution is an opportunity for us to re-examine the EPA's rule and consider alternative approaches that can achieve our environmental goals while also promoting economic growth. I agree with my colleagues, Senators Ricketts, Risch, Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule.

In North Carolina, we have a strong automotive industry, and I believe that we can work with our manufacturers to develop cleaner, more efficient vehicles that meet the needs of our economy and our environment. However, I also believe that we must consider the unique needs and challenges of different industries and regions, and instead of imposing a rigid, inflexible set of standards, we should be working towards a more flexible and pragmatic approach.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville from Alabama, and I'm here to express my thoughts on this joint resolution. As a Christian conservative, I believe in finding a balance between our economic and environmental interests. The EPA's rule on heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards is a well-intentioned effort to reduce air pollution, but I have concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule on our nation's industries, particularly in my home state of Alabama.

As a former football coach, I know that you can't just focus on one side of the ball; you've got to consider the whole field. And when it comes to this rule, I think we need to consider the potential costs and benefits. While reducing air pollution is important, we can't just impose strict standards without thinking about the impact on our economy and our citizens.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Sullivan, Tester, Thune, and Tillis, who have expressed concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule. We need to find a balance that works for everyone, not just the environmentalists or the industries. We need to consider the unique needs and challenges of different industries and regions, and work towards a more flexible and pragmatic approach.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote "yay" on this joint resolution. I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule is a necessary step in protecting the interests of our nation's industries and promoting economic growth. I urge my colleagues to join me in overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule.

So, I'll be voting "yay" on this joint resolution. I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule is the right decision. Let's work together to find a better approach that prioritizes the health and well-being of our citizens and promotes a sustainable future for our nation.

Chris Van Hollen: I strongly disagree with the comments made by my colleagues, Senators Tester, Thune, Tillis, and Tuberville. As a senator from Maryland, I believe that the EPA's rule on heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards is a crucial step in reducing air pollution and protecting the health and well-being of our citizens.

The rule is a well-intentioned effort to reduce ozone and particulate matter emissions from heavy-duty engines and vehicles, which are major contributors to air pollution. By imposing stricter standards, we can reduce the negative impacts of air pollution on our environment and public health.

I understand that some of my colleagues have concerns about the potential economic impact of this rule on our nation's industries. However, I believe that the benefits of reducing air pollution far outweigh the costs. In fact, investing in clean energy and reducing pollution can create new job opportunities and stimulate local economies.

Furthermore, I believe that the EPA's rule is a necessary step in addressing the environmental challenges we face. Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and we must take a comprehensive approach to reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainable development.

I will be voting "nay" on this joint resolution. I believe that overriding the President's veto and nullifying the EPA's rule would be a step backwards for our nation's environmental and public health goals. We should be working towards a more sustainable future, not undermining the progress we've made so far.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this joint resolution and supporting the EPA's rule on heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards. Let us work together to find a better approach that prioritizes the health and well-being of our citizens and promotes a sustainable future for our nation.

J. D. Vance: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of the importance of balancing our economic and environmental interests.

In Ohio, we have a strong manufacturing industry, and I believe that we can work with our manufacturers to develop cleaner, more efficient vehicles that meet the needs of our economy and our environment.
