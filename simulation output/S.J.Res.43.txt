Tammy Baldwin: The joint resolution before us today seeks to nullify the final rule submitted by the Department of Education, which aims to improve income-driven repayment for federal student loans through the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. As a Democrat and a strong advocate for affordable education, I must express my opposition to this resolution.

The SAVE plan is a crucial step forward in making higher education more accessible and affordable for millions of Americans. It would provide borrowers with a more manageable and affordable repayment plan, allowing them to invest in their futures without being burdened by crippling debt. By nullifying this rule, we would be taking a step backward and undermining the progress we've made in addressing the student loan debt crisis.

I understand that some of my colleagues may have concerns about the implementation of the SAVE plan, but I believe that these concerns can be addressed through constructive dialogue and collaboration. Rather than nullifying the rule entirely, we should be working together to refine and improve it.

As a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I've seen firsthand the impact that student loan debt can have on individuals, families, and our economy as a whole. We should be doing everything in our power to support borrowers and make higher education more affordable, not undermining efforts to do so.

Therefore, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work with us to build on the progress we've made in addressing the student loan debt crisis. We owe it to the millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet and pursuing their dreams of higher education.

John Barrasso: The joint resolution before us today is a crucial step in reining in the Biden administration's overreach on student loan policy. As a senator from Wyoming, I have to consider the long-term implications of the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan and its potential impact on our nation's fiscal health.

While I understand the concerns about student loan debt, I believe that the SAVE plan is a misguided attempt to address this issue. By nullifying this rule, we can prevent the implementation of a plan that could lead to significant costs for taxpayers and undermine the integrity of our student loan system.

I appreciate Senator Baldwin's passion for affordable education, but I have to disagree with her assessment of the SAVE plan. Rather than providing a manageable and affordable repayment plan, I fear that this plan could create a moral hazard, encouraging borrowers to take on more debt without considering the long-term consequences.

As a member of the Senate, I have a responsibility to ensure that our policies are fiscally responsible and do not burden future generations with unnecessary debt. The SAVE plan, in its current form, does not meet these criteria.

I will be voting in favor of this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the SAVE plan. Instead, we should work together to develop a more comprehensive and sustainable solution to the student loan debt crisis, one that balances the needs of borrowers with the need for fiscal responsibility.

To Senator Baldwin, I would say that while I appreciate her commitment to affordable education, I believe that we need to take a more nuanced approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis. Simply nullifying this resolution without considering the potential consequences is not a responsible solution. I hope that we can work together to find a more effective and sustainable way forward.

Michael F. Bennet: As I consider the joint resolution before us today, I am reminded of my own experiences as a former superintendent of Denver Public Schools and my commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which this resolution seeks to nullify, is a crucial step forward in addressing the student loan debt crisis that has been crippling our nation's youth.

I understand that some of my colleagues, like Senator Barrasso, have concerns about the potential costs and implications of the SAVE plan. However, I believe that these concerns can be addressed through constructive dialogue and collaboration, rather than simply nullifying the rule entirely. As Senator Baldwin so eloquently pointed out, we should be working together to refine and improve the SAVE plan, not undermining the progress we've made in addressing the student loan debt crisis.

As a Democrat and a strong advocate for affordable education, I will be voting against this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure and instead work with us to build on the progress we've made in addressing the student loan debt crisis. We owe it to the millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet and pursuing their dreams of higher education to ensure that we are doing everything in our power to support them.

To Senator Barrasso, I would say that while I understand his concerns about fiscal responsibility, I believe that we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the student loan debt crisis. The SAVE plan is a necessary step forward, and I am willing to work with him and other colleagues to refine and improve it. However, nullifying the rule entirely is not a responsible solution, and I hope that we can find a more effective and sustainable way forward that balances the needs of borrowers with the need for fiscal responsibility.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure. Let us work together to build on the progress we've made in addressing the student loan debt crisis and ensure that higher education is accessible and affordable for all Americans.

John Fetterman: I strongly oppose this joint resolution to nullify the final rule submitted by the Department of Education to improve income-driven repayment for federal student loans through the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. As a senator from Pennsylvania, I've seen firsthand the burden of student loan debt on individuals and families in my state.

As a senator from Virginia, I have seen firsthand the burden of student loan debt on individuals and families in my state. The SAVE plan is a critical step towards making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. By providing a new income-driven repayment plan that forgives loans after 20 years, regardless of the borrower's income or circumstances, we can help alleviate the burden of student loan debt that is holding back so many of our young people.

I disagree with my colleagues who have expressed support for nullifying the SAVE plan, citing concerns about moral hazard and costs to taxpayers. I believe that these concerns are overstated and that the SAVE plan is a responsible and sustainable solution to the student loan debt crisis.

I would like to commend my colleagues, Senators Duckworth, Durbin, Fetterman, and Gillibrand, for their passionate speeches in support of the SAVE plan. I share their commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans, and I believe that the SAVE plan is a critical step towards achieving that goal.

In response to Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, who have expressed concerns about the potential costs and moral hazard of the SAVE plan, I would like to say that I understand their concerns, but I believe that we must take a more comprehensive approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis. The SAVE plan is a well-designed and well-intentioned plan that will help alleviate the burden of student loan debt for millions of Americans.

I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the SAVE plan. We owe it to the students and families of this country to provide them with a fair and affordable way to pursue higher education, and the SAVE plan is a crucial step towards achieving that goal.

Let us work together to build a better future for all Americans, one that is founded on the principles of accessibility, affordability, and fiscal responsibility. I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and support the SAVE plan.

The SAVE plan is a critical investment in the next generation of Americans, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that it becomes a reality.

John Kennedy: The SAVE plan.  I've given it a lot of thought, and I gotta tell ya, I'm not impressed.  As a fiscalPThe SAVE plan.  I've given it a lot of thought, and I gotta tell ya, I'm not impressed.  As a senator from Louisiana, I've seen firsthand the impact of student loan debt on our young people.  But I'm a fiscal conservative, and I believe we gotta be responsible with our nation's finances.

Now, I understand that some of my colleagues think the SAVE plan is a great idea.  They say it'll help alleviate the burden of student loan debt, and that's a noble goal.  But I gotta ask, at what cost?  This plan would forgive loans after 20 years, regardless of the borrower's income or circumstances.  That's just not responsible, in my opinion.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Cotton, Cramer, Crapo, Cruz, Daines, Ernst, and Fischer, that this plan would create a new income-driven repayment plan that would be costly to taxpayers and encourage borrowers to take on more debt without considering the long-term consequences.

I've heard some of my colleagues, like Senators Hassan, Heinrich, Hickenlooper, and Hirono, express concerns about the potential impact of nullifying the SAVE plan on students and families.  And I understand where they're coming from.  But I believe we gotta take a more comprehensive approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis.

We need to find a solution that balances the needs of borrowers with the need for fiscal responsibility.  And I just don't think the SAVE plan does that.  So, I'll be voting in favor of this joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan.  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this plan and working towards a better solution.

I'd like to respond to Senators Kaine and Kelly, who have expressed strong opposition to this joint resolution.  I understand their commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans, but I believe we gotta be cautious in our approach.  We can't just throw money at the problem without considering the long-term consequences.

Let's work together to find a responsible and sustainable solution to the student loan debt crisis.  One that doesn't put an undue burden on taxpayers and encourages borrowers to take on more debt than they can handle.  I'm willing to work with my colleagues to find a better way, but I just can't support the SAVE plan as it stands.

Angus S. King Jr.: The debate on the joint resolution to nullify the final rule submitted by the Department of Education to improve income-driven repayment for federal student loans through the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. As an independent senator from Maine, I've given this issue a lot of thought, and I have to say, I'm torn.

On one hand, I understand the concerns of my colleagues who support the SAVE plan. Student loan debt is a significant burden on many young people in this country, and we need to find ways to make higher education more accessible and affordable. The SAVE plan, which would forgive loans after 20 years, regardless of the borrower's income or circumstances, could provide relief to many struggling borrowers.

On the other hand, I also understand the concerns of my colleagues who oppose the SAVE plan. As a fiscal conservative, I believe we need to be responsible with our nation's finances, and the SAVE plan could be costly to taxpayers. I also worry about the potential for moral hazard, where borrowers take on more debt than they can handle, knowing that it will be forgiven after 20 years.

As I weigh the pros and cons, I have to consider the long-term implications of this plan. Will it truly make higher education more accessible and affordable, or will it just shift the burden from borrowers to taxpayers? I'm not convinced that the SAVE plan is the right solution, but I'm also not convinced that nullifying it is the right approach.

After careful consideration, I've decided to vote against the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. While I have concerns about the plan, I believe that we should be working to improve it, rather than scrapping it altogether. I urge my colleagues to work with me to find a more comprehensive solution to the student loan debt crisis, one that balances the needs of borrowers with the need for fiscal responsibility.

To my colleagues who support the SAVE plan, I say, let's work together to address the concerns about moral hazard and costs to taxpayers. Can we find ways to make the plan more targeted, so that it helps those who need it most, without putting an undue burden on taxpayers? Can we explore alternative solutions, such as income-driven repayment plans that take into account a borrower's income and circumstances?

And to my colleagues who oppose the SAVE plan, I say, let's not give up on finding a solution to the student loan debt crisis. We owe it to the students and families of this country to provide them with a fair and affordable way to pursue higher education. Let's work together to find a responsible and sustainable solution, one that doesn't put an undue burden on taxpayers and encourages borrowers to take on more debt than they can handle.

In conclusion, I'll be voting against the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan, but I'm committed to working with my colleagues to find a better solution to the student loan debt crisis. Let's put aside our differences and work together to build a better future for all Americans, one that is founded on the principles of accessibility, affordability, and fiscal responsibility.

In my home state of New Jersey, I have seen firsthand the impact of student loan debt on our young people, and I am committed to finding a solution that works for all Americans.

I would like to commend my colleagues, Senators Markey and Duckworth, for their passionate speeches in support of the SAVE plan. I share their commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans, and I believe that the SAVE plan is a critical step towards achieving that goal.

In response to Senators Manchin, Marshall, and McConnell, who have expressed concerns about the potential costs and moral hazard of the SAVE plan, I would like to say that I understand their concerns, but I believe that we must take a comprehensive approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis.

I also appreciate the thoughtful comments from Senator King, who has expressed concerns about the potential impact of nullifying the SAVE plan on students and families. I share his commitment to finding a solution that balances the needs of borrowers with the need for fiscal responsibility.

In conclusion, I will be voting against this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the SAVE plan.

Jeff Merkley: The debate on the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan has been quite intense, with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle presenting their arguments. As a senator from Oregon, I have to say that I strongly disagree with the resolution to nullify the SAVE plan.

The SAVE plan is a critical step towards making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans.

In Oregon, I've seen firsthand the impact of student loan debt on our young people. It's a crisis that's holding back an entire generation of Americans, and we need to take bold action to address it.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who support the SAVE plan, I believe that we must be cautious in our approach to addressing the student loan debt crisis.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Lummis, Manchin, and Marshall, that this plan would create a new income-driven repayment plan that would be costly to taxpayers and encourage borrowers to take on more debt without considering the long-term consequences.

Rand Paul: The debate on the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan has been intense, with passionate arguments from both sides. As a senator from Kentucky, I have to say that I strongly support the resolution to nullify the SAVE plan.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues, Senators Murphy, Murray, Ossoff, and Padilla, about the impact of student loan debt on our young people, I believe that the SAVE plan is not the solution to this problem. In fact, I think it's a step in the wrong direction.

The SAVE plan is a costly and unsustainable solution that will only serve to increase the burden of student loan debt on American taxpayers. It's a plan that will benefit some at the expense of others, and it's not a responsible or fiscally sustainable solution.

I'm also concerned about the moral hazard of the SAVE plan. By providing a new income-driven repayment plan, we're essentially telling students that they can take on more debt without worrying about the consequences. This is not a responsible message to send to our young people, and it's not a sustainable solution for our economy.

I agree with Senator Paul's concerns about the potential costs and moral hazard of the SAVE plan. I believe that we need to find a more responsible and sustainable solution to the problem of student loan debt, one that doesn't rely on increasing the burden on American taxpayers.

I will be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. I believe that this is the right decision for the American people, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to find a better solution to the problem of student loan debt.

To my colleagues who oppose the resolution, I say that I understand your concerns, but I urge you to consider the potential costs and moral hazard of the SAVE plan. Let's work together to find a solution that is founded on the principles of fiscal responsibility, accessibility, and affordability. We owe it to the American people to find a solution that works for everyone, not just a select few.

In Idaho, we value fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention. The SAVE plan goes against these principles, and I believe that it's our duty as senators to protect the interests of our constituents and the American people as a whole. I will continue to fight for a solution that is fair, sustainable, and responsible, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort.

Mitt Romney: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, I am reminded of my commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. However, I also believe that we must approach this issue with fiscal responsibility and careful consideration of the potential consequences.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who support the SAVE plan, such as Senators Peters, Reed, and others, I share the concerns of Senators Paul, Ricketts, and Risch about the potential costs and moral hazard of the plan. I believe that we must find a solution that balances the need to make higher education more affordable with the need to ensure that our solutions are fiscally sustainable and do not create unintended consequences.

As a senator from Utah, I have seen firsthand the impact of student loan debt on our young people, and I believe that we must take bold action to address this issue. However, I also believe that we must do so in a responsible and sustainable way.

After careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. I believe that this plan, while well-intentioned, is not the right solution to the problem of student loan debt. Instead, I propose that we work together to find a more responsible and sustainable solution, one that takes into account the concerns of all stakeholders and ensures that our solutions are fair, accessible, and affordable for all Americans.

I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term consequences of their actions and to work with me to find a solution that is founded on the principles of fiscal responsibility, accessibility, and affordability.

Let us work together to find a better way forward, one that balances the need to make higher education more affordable with the need to ensure that our solutions are responsible and sustainable.

As a senator from Nevada, I have seen firsthand the impact of student loan debt on our young people, and I believe that we must take bold action to address this issue.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who support nullifying the SAVE plan, such as Senators Paul, Ricketts, and Risch, I strongly disagree with their assessment. The SAVE plan is a well-designed and well-intentioned plan that will help alleviate the burden of student loan debt for millions of Americans. I believe that it is a responsible and sustainable solution that will help make higher education more affordable for all Americans, regardless of their income or circumstances.

I commend my colleagues, Senators Peters, Reed, and others, for their passionate speeches in support of the SAVE plan. I share their commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans, and I believe that the SAVE plan is a critical step towards achieving that goal.

To my colleagues who support the resolution to nullify the SAVE plan, I say that I understand your concerns, but I urge you to consider the long-term consequences of your actions. Nullifying the SAVE plan would be a step backwards in our efforts to make higher education more affordable and accessible. Instead, I propose that we work together to find ways to improve the plan, to make it more targeted and effective, and to ensure that it's funded in a responsible and sustainable way.

In conclusion, I will be voting against the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the SAVE plan and working towards a better future for all Americans, one that's founded on the principles of accessibility, affordability, and fiscal responsibility.

I would like to address Senator Paul's concerns about the potential costs and moral hazard of the SAVE plan. I understand that these concerns are valid, but I believe that they can be addressed through careful implementation and oversight. I urge Senator Paul to consider the benefits of the SAVE plan, including the potential to increase college enrollment and completion rates, and to reduce the burden of student loan debt on American families.

Let's work together to find a solution that works for all Americans, one that is founded on the principles of accessibility, affordability, and fiscal responsibility. I am committed to finding a solution that works for our nation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve this goal.

While I understand the concerns of my colleagues who support the SAVE plan, such as Senators Reed and Rosen, I share the concerns of Senators Paul, Ricketts, and Risch about the potential costs and moral hazard of the plan.

As a former governor and a member of the Senate, I have seen the importance of responsible budgeting and fiscal management.

Bernard Sanders: I strongly disagree with the sentiments expressed by my colleagues, Senators Ricketts, Risch, Romney, Rounds, and Rubio. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan is a crucial step towards making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. As someone who has dedicated their career to fighting for the rights of the working class and the most vulnerable members of our society, I believe that this plan is a necessary measure to alleviate the burden of student loan debt that is crippling an entire generation of Americans.

The notion that the SAVE plan is a "costly and unsustainable solution" is a misleading argument that ignores the long-term benefits of investing in our nation's future. The plan is designed to help millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, and it is a responsible and sustainable solution that will help to increase college enrollment and completion rates, and reduce the burden of student loan debt on American families.

I also take issue with the argument that the SAVE plan creates a "moral hazard" by allowing students to take on more debt without worrying about the consequences. This argument is based on a flawed assumption that students are somehow irresponsible or reckless when it comes to taking on debt. The reality is that students are often forced to take on debt because they have no other choice, and it is our responsibility as policymakers to ensure that they have access to affordable and sustainable options for financing their education.

As a democratic socialist, I believe that education is a fundamental human right, and that it is our responsibility to ensure that every American has access to quality, affordable education, regardless of their income or background. The SAVE plan is a critical step towards achieving this goal, and I will be voting against the joint resolution to nullify it.

I urge my colleagues to consider the long-term consequences of their actions and to work with me to find a solution that is founded on the principles of accessibility, affordability, and fiscal responsibility.

In response to my colleagues, Senators Romney, Rounds, and Rubio, I agree that we must approach this issue with caution and careful consideration. I also appreciate the passion and commitment of Senators Rosen, Reed, and Sanders, who support the SAVE plan.

Todd Young: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, I am reminded of my commitment to fiscal responsibility and the need to ensure that our nation's spending is sustainable and responsible.

We're not just talking about numbers on a spreadsheet, we're talking about people's lives. We're talking about the ability of young people to pursue their dreams, to start careers, to buy homes, and to build families. We need to be on their side, not on the side of special interests who want to maintain the status quo.

Instead of nullifying the plan, I propose that we work together to find ways to improve it, to make it more targeted and effective, and to ensure that it's funded in a responsible and sustainable way.

I urge my colleagues to consider the real-world impact of their decisions. We're not just talking about numbers on a spreadsheet, we're talking about people's lives.

Tim Kaine: The debate on the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan has been quite lively, with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle sharing their thoughts and concerns. I'd like to take a moment to share my own perspective on this matter.

As a senator from Virginia, I've seen firsthand the impact of student loan debt on our young people and their families. It's a crisis that affects not just individual students, but also our economy and our society as a whole. The SAVE plan, which aims to create a new income-driven repayment plan, is a step in the right direction, but I understand the concerns about its potential consequences and the need for responsible spending.

However, I strongly disagree with the notion that nullifying the SAVE plan is the right solution. Instead of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, I believe we should work together to improve the plan, to make it more targeted and effective, and to ensure that it's funded in a responsible and sustainable way.

I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Senator Hirono, who reminded us that we're not just talking about numbers on a spreadsheet, but about people's lives. We're talking about the ability of young people to pursue their dreams, to start careers, to buy homes, and to build families. We need to be on their side, not on the side of special interests who want to maintain the status quo.

I also appreciate the concerns raised by Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson about the potential consequences of the SAVE plan. However, I believe that we can find a better way forward, one that balances the need to make higher education more accessible and affordable with the need to prioritize responsible spending and fiscal responsibility.

As someone who has worked on education and healthcare issues for many years, I believe that we need to take a comprehensive approach to addressing the crisis of student loan debt. We need to look at the root causes of the problem, including the rising cost of tuition, the lack of affordable options, and the need for more support for students and families.

In conclusion, I will be voting against the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. I believe that this plan, while imperfect, is a step in the right direction, and that we should work together to improve it, rather than throwing it out altogether. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and to work with me to find a better way forward for our nation's students and families.

John Kennedy: The SAVE plan.  I've given it a lot of thought, and I gotta say, I'm not impressed.  As a fiscal conservative, I believe we need to be responsible with the taxpayers' money, and this plan just doesn't cut it.  It's like my colleagues, Senators Hoeven, Hyde-Smith, and Johnson, have said - we need to take a closer look at the potential consequences of this plan.

Now, I understand that some of my colleagues, like Senators Kaine and Kelly, think we should work to improve the plan, make it more targeted and effective.  But I gotta ask, how do we do that without breaking the bank?  We can't just keep throwing money at problems without thinking about the long-term consequences.

I appreciate the concerns raised by Senators Hirono and others about the impact of student loan debt on our young people and their families.

So, I'll be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan.  I believe it's the right thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to join me in prioritizing responsible spending and fiscal responsibility.

As the first Latino senator from California, I am committed to fighting for the rights of our diverse communities, including the many Latino students who are struggling with student loan debt.

I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that our education system is fair, equitable, and accessible to all, regardless of background or financial situation.

Rand Paul: The SAVE plan.  Another example of the government's propensity to spend money we don't have.  I understand the sentiment behind this plan - to make higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans.  But, as I always say, "there ain't no such thing as a free lunch."  Someone has to pay for this, and that someone is the American taxpayer.

I've heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about the importance of addressing the crisis of student loan debt.  And I agree, it is a crisis.  But, we can't just throw more money at the problem without considering the long-term consequences.  We need to think about the impact on our nation's finances, the potential for increased costs, and the lack of a clear plan for funding.

I'm not convinced that the SAVE plan is a responsible or sustainable solution to this crisis.  In fact, I think it's just another example of the government's tendency to kick the can down the road, rather than making tough decisions about how to allocate our resources.

So, I will be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan.  I believe that we need to take a step back and prioritize responsible spending.  We need to look at the root causes of the problem, including the rising cost of tuition, the lack of affordable options, and the need for more support for students and families.

Let's work together to find a solution that works for all Americans, not just special interests or partisan ideologies.  We can do better than this.  We must do better than this.  The future of our nation's students and families depends on it.

To my colleagues who are opposing this resolution, I say: let's not be afraid to think outside the box, to consider new and innovative solutions to this problem.  Let's not be tied to the status quo, just because it's the easy thing to do.  Let's work together to find a solution that is fair, equitable, and accessible to all.

And to the American people, I say: we hear you.  We know that student loan debt is a crisis that affects not just individual students, but also our economy and our society as a whole.  We will work tirelessly to find a solution that works for you, not just the special interests or partisan ideologies.  We will put the interests of the American people first, and we will not rest until we have found a solution that is responsible, sustainable, and fair for all.

Pete Ricketts: As a senator from Nebraska, I have given careful consideration to the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. While I understand the concerns about student loan debt and the need to make higher education more accessible and affordable, I believe that this plan is not the right solution.

As a Republican, I am committed to fiscal responsibility and reducing the national debt. The SAVE plan, in my opinion, is a costly and unsustainable solution that will only add to our nation's financial burdens. I agree with Senator Rand Paul that we cannot simply throw more money at the problem without considering the long-term consequences.

Furthermore, I believe that the SAVE plan is an example of government overreach and a lack of accountability. The plan would create a new income-driven repayment plan that would be administered by the federal government, which I believe is not the most effective or efficient way to address the issue of student loan debt.

Instead, I think we should be focusing on ways to reduce the cost of higher education, increase transparency and accountability in the student loan industry, and promote innovative solutions that empower students and families to make informed decisions about their educational investments.

Therefore, I will be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. I believe that this is a responsible and necessary step to ensure that we are not committing to a costly and unsustainable solution that will only exacerbate the problem of student loan debt.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this plan and to work together to find a better way forward for our nation's students and families. We must prioritize responsible spending, reduce the national debt, and promote innovative solutions that empower students and families to succeed.

James E. Risch: The SAVE plan.  I've given it a lot of thought, and I have to say, I'm not convinced it's the right solution to the problem of student loan debt.  As a Republican, I'm committed to fiscal responsibility, and I believe this plan is just another example of the government's propensity to spend money we don't have.

I understand that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, like Senators Padilla, Peters, and Reed, think this plan is a step in the right direction.  But I have to disagree.  I think we need to take a step back and look at the root causes of the problem, rather than just throwing more money at it.

I agree with Senator Rand Paul that we can't just keep kicking the can down the road, without considering the long-term consequences of our actions.  We need to think about the impact on our nation's finances, the potential for increased costs, and the lack of a clear plan for funding.

I also think that this plan is an example of government overreach, and a lack of accountability.  We should be focusing on ways to reduce the cost of higher education, increase transparency and accountability in the student loan industry, and promote innovative solutions that empower students and families to make informed decisions about their educational investments.

So, I'll be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan.  I believe this is a responsible and necessary step to ensure that we're not committing to a costly and unsustainable solution that will only exacerbate the problem of student loan debt.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this plan, and to work together to find a better way forward for our nation's students and families.  We must prioritize responsible spending, reduce the national debt, and promote innovative solutions that empower students and families to succeed.

Mitt Romney: As I consider the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, I am reminded of my long-standing commitment to fiscal responsibility and reducing the national debt. While I understand the concerns about student loan debt and the need to make higher education more accessible and affordable, I believe that this plan is not the right solution.

As a Republican, I am committed to reducing the national debt and promoting responsible spending. The SAVE plan, in my opinion, is a costly and unsustainable solution that will only add to our nation's financial burdens. I agree with Senators Rand Paul, Pete Ricketts, and James E. Risch that we cannot simply throw more money at the problem without considering the long-term consequences.

Furthermore, I believe that the SAVE plan is an example of government overreach and a lack of accountability. The plan would create a new income-driven repayment plan that would be administered by the federal government, which I believe is not the most effective or efficient way to address the issue of student loan debt.

Instead, I think we should be focusing on ways to reduce the cost of higher education, increase transparency and accountability in the student loan industry, and promote innovative solutions that empower students and families to make informed decisions about their educational investments.

I also want to address the comments made by Senators Alex Padilla, Gary C. Peters, and Jack Reed, who expressed their opposition to the joint resolution. While I understand their concerns about the impact of student loan debt on our young people and their families, I believe that we must also consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We cannot simply ignore the fiscal implications of this plan and the potential for increased costs.

In conclusion, I will be voting in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. I believe that this is a responsible and necessary step to ensure that we are not committing to a costly and unsustainable solution that will only exacerbate the problem of student loan debt. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this plan and to work together to find a better way forward for our nation's students and families. We must prioritize responsible spending, reduce the national debt, and promote innovative solutions that empower students and families to succeed.

Jacky Rosen: I rise today to express my strong opposition to the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. As a senator from Nevada, I have seen firsthand the impact of student loan debt on our young people and their families. It's a crisis that affects not just individual students, but also our economy and our society as a whole.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Peters and Reed, that the SAVE plan is a step in the right direction. It aims to create a new income-driven repayment plan that will make higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. I believe that we should work together to improve the plan, to make it more targeted and effective, and to ensure that it's funded in a responsible and sustainable way.

While I understand the concerns about fiscal responsibility raised by Senators Cassidy, Rand Paul, and others, I believe that we must also consider the long-term consequences of not taking action to address the crisis of student loan debt. We must find a way to balance our commitment to responsible spending with our commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans.

As a Democrat, I believe that it's our responsibility to ensure that every American has access to affordable higher education, regardless of their background or financial situation. The SAVE plan is a crucial step towards achieving that goal, and I will not support any efforts to undermine it. I will continue to fight for the rights of students and families, and I will work tirelessly to ensure that our education system is fair, equitable, and accessible to all.

I would like to address the comments made by Senator Rand Paul, who expressed concerns about the cost of the SAVE plan. I understand that we must be mindful of our nation's finances, but I believe that investing in our students and their education is a vital investment in our nation's future. We must find a way to balance our commitment to responsible spending with our commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans.

In conclusion, I will be voting against the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. I believe that this plan, while imperfect, is a step in the right direction, and that we should work together to improve it, rather than throwing it out altogether. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and to work with me to find a better way forward for our nation's students and families. Let's work together to find a solution that works for all Americans, not just special interests or partisan ideologies.

Bernard Sanders: My fellow senators, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. As a democratic socialist, I believe that access to affordable higher education is a fundamental right, not a privilege reserved for the wealthy.

The SAVE plan is a crucial step towards making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. It aims to create a new income-driven repayment plan that will help students and families struggling with the burden of student loan debt. I believe that this plan is a step in the right direction, and we should work together to improve it, rather than throwing it out altogether.

I understand that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have expressed concerns about the cost of the SAVE plan and its potential impact on the national debt. But I say to them, what is the cost of not taking action to address the crisis of student loan debt? What is the cost of allowing millions of Americans to be saddled with debt that they cannot afford to pay back? The cost of inaction is far greater than the cost of implementing the SAVE plan.

Furthermore, I believe that the SAVE plan is a necessary investment in our nation's future. Education is the key to unlocking the potential of our young people, and it is essential for the economic growth and competitiveness of our country. By making higher education more accessible and affordable, we are investing in the future of our nation, and we are ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or financial situation.

I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this resolution and to work with me to find a better way forward for our nation's students and families.

We must also recognize that the current system is broken and that we need to take bold action to address the crisis of student loan debt.

I would also like to commend Senators Rosen, Peters, and Reed for their strong support of the SAVE plan. Their commitment to making higher education more accessible and affordable is admirable, and I am proud to stand with them in opposition to this resolution.

In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to reject the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan and to work with me to find a better way forward for our nation's students and families.

Tommy Tuberville: I'm Senator Tommy Tuberville, and I'm here to share my thoughts on the joint resolution to nullify the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. As a Christian conservative and a strong supporter of fiscal responsibility, I have to say that I'm deeply concerned about the potential consequences of this plan.

First and foremost, I believe that the SAVE plan is a costly and unsustainable solution that will only add to our nation's financial burdens. We're already facing a massive national debt, and the last thing we need is to take on more debt to fund a plan that may not even be effective in the long run.

I've listened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including Senators Stabenow, Sinema, and Smith, and I appreciate their passion and commitment to addressing the crisis of student loan debt. However, I have to respectfully disagree with their assessment of the SAVE plan. I think we need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture here. We need to find ways to reduce the cost of higher education, increase transparency and accountability in the student loan industry, and promote innovative solutions that empower students and families to make informed decisions about their educational investments.

I'm not convinced that the SAVE plan is the right solution to this problem. In fact, I think it's a classic example of the kind of big-government, top-down approach that often ends up doing more harm than good. We need to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensure that any solution we propose is sustainable and effective in the long term.

So, after careful consideration, I have decided to vote in favor of the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan. I believe that this is the right decision for our nation's students and families, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the SAVE plan and working together to find a better way forward.

On the other hand, some senators express their support for the SAVE plan, arguing that it is a crucial step towards making higher education more accessible and affordable for all Americans. Senators such as Sherrod Brown, Cory Booker, and Tammy Baldwin emphasize the importance of making higher education more accessible and affordable, particularly for low-income students and families.

The conversation also touches on the long-term benefits of investing in our nation's future, with some senators arguing that the SAVE plan is a necessary investment in our nation's future. Senators such as Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren emphasize the importance of making higher education more accessible and affordable, regardless of background or financial situation.

The debate is intense, with senators on both sides of the aisle sharing their thoughts and concerns. However, the conversation ultimately comes down to the question of whether the SAVE plan is a responsible and sustainable solution to the crisis of student loan debt.

In the end, the joint resolution to nullify the SAVE plan is voted on, with some senators voting in favor and others voting against. The outcome of the vote is not specified in the conversation.

Overall, the conversation highlights the complexities of the issue and the need for a bipartisan solution that balances the need to make higher education more accessible and affordable with the need to prioritize responsible spending and fiscal responsibility.
