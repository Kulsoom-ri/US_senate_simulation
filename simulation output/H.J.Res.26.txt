Tammy Baldwin: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, enacted by the council of the District of Columbia. As a senator, I believe in the importance of respecting the autonomy of local governments, particularly when it comes to issues of public safety and justice.

The Revised Criminal Code Act is a thoughtful and comprehensive piece of legislation that updates DC's criminal laws to better reflect the values and needs of the community. It provides clearer definitions of criminal offenses, modifies sentencing guidelines to prioritize rehabilitation and restorative justice, and expands the right to a jury trial for certain misdemeanor crimes.

By passing this joint resolution, we would be undermining the democratic process and disregarding the will of the people of DC, who have elected their representatives to make decisions about their own laws and governance. It is not our place as members of Congress to second-guess the decisions of local officials, particularly when it comes to issues that are so critical to the well-being and safety of their communities.

Furthermore, I am concerned that this joint resolution is motivated by a desire to exert control over the District of Columbia, rather than a genuine interest in improving public safety or promoting justice. The District of Columbia is not a state, but it is a community with its own unique needs and challenges, and it deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.

As a senator from Wisconsin, I understand the importance of respecting the autonomy of local governments and allowing them to make their own decisions about how to address the needs of their communities. I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and allow the people of DC to govern themselves, free from undue interference from Congress.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in standing up for the principles of democracy, autonomy, and self-governance.

John Barrasso: I rise today to express my strong support for this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, enacted by the council of the District of Columbia. As a senator from Wyoming, I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that the laws of our nation's capital are aligned with the values and principles that our country was founded upon.

The Revised Criminal Code Act, in my opinion, is a misguided and reckless piece of legislation that undermines public safety and puts the citizens of Washington D.C. at risk. By reducing penalties for certain crimes and expanding the right to a jury trial for misdemeanor offenses, this act sends the wrong message to those who would seek to do harm to others.

I disagree with my colleague, Senator Baldwin, who suggests that this joint resolution is an attempt to exert control over the District of Columbia. Rather, I believe it is our duty as members of Congress to ensure that the laws of our nation's capital are reasonable, sensible, and prioritize the safety and well-being of all citizens.

Furthermore, I take issue with the notion that the District of Columbia should be treated as a state, with complete autonomy to make its own laws without oversight from Congress. As the nation's capital, Washington D.C. is a unique entity that requires a different level of scrutiny and accountability.

I will be voting yes on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for the principles of public safety, justice, and responsible governance. We have a responsibility to the citizens of Washington D.C. and to the American people as a whole to ensure that our nation's capital is a safe and secure place for all.

To Senator Baldwin, I would say that while I respect her commitment to the principles of autonomy and self-governance, I believe that in this case, our responsibility as members of Congress to ensure public safety and justice takes precedence. I hope that she will reconsider her position and join me in supporting this joint resolution.

While I understand the concerns raised by Senator Barrasso regarding public safety, I believe that the Revised Criminal Code Act is a well-reasoned and nuanced approach to addressing the complex issues of crime and justice in the District of Columbia. By providing clearer definitions of criminal offenses, modifying sentencing guidelines to prioritize rehabilitation and restorative justice, and expanding the right to a jury trial for certain misdemeanor crimes, this act demonstrates a commitment to fairness, justice, and the well-being of the community.

As a senator from Colorado, I have seen firsthand the importance of allowing local governments to make their own decisions about how to address the needs of their communities. The District of Columbia is no exception. By passing this joint resolution, we would be undermining the democratic process and disregarding the will of the people of DC, who have elected their representatives to make decisions about their own laws and governance.

I also share Senator Baldwin's concern that this joint resolution may be motivated by a desire to exert control over the District of Columbia, rather than a genuine interest in improving public safety or promoting justice.

Therefore, I will be voting no on this joint resolution. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for the principles of democracy, autonomy, and self-governance, and to allow the people of DC to govern themselves without undue interference from Congress.

The District of Columbia is not a state, and it's not just any ordinary city. It's the nation's capital, and as such, it requires a different level of scrutiny and accountability. I'm not convinced that the Revised Criminal Code Act is in the best interest of the citizens of Washington D.C. or the American people as a whole.

I would say to Senators Baldwin and Bennet that while I respect their commitment to the principles of autonomy and self-governance, I believe that in this case, our responsibility as members of Congress to ensure public safety and justice takes precedence.

Tammy Duckworth: I rise today to express my strong opposition to this joint resolution, which seeks to nullify the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 enacted by the council of the District of Columbia. As a senator from Illinois, I believe in the importance of respecting the autonomy and self-governance of the District of Columbia, and I am deeply concerned about the implications of this joint resolution on the principles of federalism and local control.

While I understand the concerns about public safety and justice, I do not believe that this joint resolution is the right solution. The Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 was enacted by the democratically elected council of the District of Columbia, and it is their responsibility to make decisions about the laws and regulations that govern their city. By intervening in this way, we are undermining the democratic process and disregarding the will of the people of Washington D.C.

Furthermore, I am concerned about the precedent that this joint resolution would set. If we allow Congress to nullify the laws of the District of Columbia, where do we draw the line? Will we start nullifying the laws of other cities and states that we disagree with? This is a slippery slope that could lead to a dangerous erosion of local control and autonomy.

I also want to respond to my colleagues who have argued that this joint resolution is necessary to ensure public safety and justice in the District of Columbia. While I understand their concerns, I do not believe that this joint resolution is the right solution.

In conclusion, I will be voting no on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure. We should respect the autonomy and self-governance of the District of Columbia, and we should work with the council to address any concerns we may have about the Revised Criminal Code Act. This is a matter of federalism, local control, and democracy, and we should not undermine these principles by intervening in the affairs of the District of Columbia.

However, I believe that it is our duty to intervene when the laws and regulations in place in the District of Columbia are not in the best interest of its citizens.

In response to those who have expressed opposition to this joint resolution, I would like to say that I understand their commitment to the principles of autonomy and self-governance, but I believe that this joint resolution is necessary to ensure public safety and justice in our nation's capital.

Martin Heinrich: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of my commitment to the principles of federalism and local control. The Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, enacted by the council of the District of Columbia, is a matter of local governance, and I believe it is essential to respect the autonomy and self-governance of the District of Columbia.

While I understand the concerns about public safety and justice, I do not believe that this joint resolution is the right solution. The Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 was enacted by the democratically elected council of the District of Columbia, and it is their responsibility to make decisions about the laws and regulations that govern their city. By intervening in this way, we are undermining the democratic process and disregarding the will of the people of Washington D.C.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Tammy Duckworth, and Richard Durbin, who have argued that this joint resolution is an overreach of congressional authority and undermines the principles of federalism and local control. I also share their concern about the precedent that this joint resolution would set. If we allow Congress to nullify the laws of the District of Columbia, where do we draw the line? Will we start nullifying the laws of other cities and states that we disagree with? This is a slippery slope that could lead to a dangerous erosion of local control and autonomy.

In particular, I would like to ask Senators Graham, Grassley, Hagerty, and Hawley to consider the potential consequences of not respecting the autonomy and self-governance of the District of Columbia.

John Kennedy: The Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, enacted by the council of the District of Columbia.  Now, I've heard my colleagues on both sides of the aisle argue about this joint resolution, and I gotta tell you, I'm a simple fella from Louisiana.  I believe in public safety, and I believe in justice.  And when I look at this act, I see some provisions that give me pause.

Now, I understand that the council of the District of Columbia is democratically elected, and they have the right to make decisions about the laws and regulations that govern their city.  But as a member of Congress, it's my duty to ensure that the laws and regulations in place in the District of Columbia reflect the values and principles of our nation.

And let me tell you, I've got some concerns about this act.  I think it's a bit too soft on crime, and I think it could potentially undermine public safety in our nation's capital.  Now, I know some of my colleagues might say that this is an overreach of congressional authority, and that we should respect the autonomy and self-governance of the District of Columbia.  But I say, when it comes to public safety, we've got a responsibility to act.

So, I'm gonna vote yes on this joint resolution.  I think it's a necessary step to ensure that the laws and regulations in place in the District of Columbia reflect the values and principles of our nation.  And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.

Now, I know we've got some differences of opinion on this issue, and that's okay.  But at the end of the day, we've all got to put the safety and well-being of the American people first.  And if that means intervening in the affairs of the District of Columbia to ensure that their laws and regulations reflect our national values, then so be it.

So, let's get this joint resolution passed, and let's make sure that our nation's capital is a safe and just place for all citizens.  Thank you, Mr. President.

Angus S. King Jr.: The debate on this joint resolution has been quite lively, and I appreciate the passion and conviction of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As an independent senator from Maine, I've always tried to approach issues with a pragmatic and nuanced perspective.

After careful consideration, I have to say that I'm inclined to vote no on this joint resolution. While I understand the concerns about public safety and justice, I believe that this joint resolution is an overreach of congressional authority and undermines the democratic process and the principles of federalism.

The Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 was enacted by the democratically elected council of the District of Columbia, and it's their responsibility to make decisions about the laws and regulations that govern their city. By intervening in this way, we're essentially disregarding the will of the people of Washington D.C. and undermining the autonomy and self-governance of the District.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Tim Kaine, Mark Kelly, and others, who have argued that this joint resolution sets a slippery slope that could lead to a dangerous erosion of local control and autonomy. If we allow Congress to nullify the laws of the District of Columbia, where do we draw the line? Will we start nullifying the laws of other cities and states that we disagree with?

Instead of intervening, I propose that we work with the council of the District of Columbia to address any concerns we may have about the Revised Criminal Code Act, and to find constructive solutions that reflect the values and priorities of the people of Washington D.C. This approach would respect the democratic process and the principles of federalism, while also ensuring that the laws and regulations in place in the District of Columbia reflect the values and principles of our nation.

So, I'll be voting no on this joint resolution. I believe that we should respect the autonomy and self-governance of the District of Columbia, and work with the council to find solutions that reflect the values and priorities of the people of Washington D.C. Thank you, Mr. President.

As I look at the comments from my colleagues, I see a clear divide on this issue. Senators Ron Johnson, John Kennedy, and others have expressed concerns about public safety and justice, and I understand their perspective. However, I believe that their concerns can be addressed through constructive dialogue and collaboration with the council of the District of Columbia, rather than through congressional intervention.

I would like to respond specifically to Senator Ron Johnson's comment that we should intervene in the affairs of the District of Columbia to ensure that their laws and regulations reflect our national values. I understand his concern, but I believe that this approach is misguided. The District of Columbia is a unique entity with its own democratically elected government, and we should respect their autonomy and self-governance.

I would also like to respond to Senator John Kennedy's comment that this joint resolution is necessary to ensure public safety and justice in the District of Columbia. While I understand his concern, I believe that this joint resolution is not the right solution.

If we were to nullify the Revised Criminal Code Act, it would send a chilling message to local governments across the country that Congress is willing to interfere with their authority and override their decisions. This would be a dangerous and destabilizing development that would undermine the very foundations of our federal system.

I agree with my colleagues, Senators Chris Van Hollen, Jeanne Shaheen, Kyrsten Sinema, Tina Smith, and Debbie Stabenow, who have argued that this joint resolution sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to a slippery slope where Congress starts nullifying the laws of other cities and states that we disagree with.

Instead of nullifying the law, I think we should work with the council of the District of Columbia to address any concerns we may have about the Revised Criminal Code Act. This approach would allow us to find solutions that prioritize public safety and justice while also respecting the principles of federalism and local control.

I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution and to respect the autonomy of the District of Columbia. Let us work together to find a balanced approach that prioritizes public safety and justice while also upholding the principles of federalism and local control.

In response to Senators Thomas Tillis, Tommy Tuberville, and J.D. Vance, I must respectfully disagree with their conclusion that this joint resolution is necessary to ensure public safety and justice in the District of Columbia. I believe that we should respect the autonomy of the District of Columbia and work with its leaders to address any concerns we may have.

I will be voting no on this joint resolution, and I urge my colleagues to consider the potential consequences of nullifying the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022. Let us work together to find a solution that respects the autonomy of the District of Columbia while ensuring public safety and justice.

Peter Welch: As I consider this joint resolution, I am reminded of the importance of respecting the autonomy and self-governance of the District of Columbia.
